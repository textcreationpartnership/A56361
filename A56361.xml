            <title>The covenant of nature made with Adam described and cleared from sundry great mistakes. And thereby proving, I. That the kind of death that was threatned in that covenant, in Gen. 2.17. ought not to be understood of any other kind of death but of a double spiritual death, 1. By depriving Adam of Gods concreated image: and 2. By corruption of nature that followed thereupon. II. Proving that the said covenant was totally extinguished and made utterly null, as soon as Adam had but tasted of the forbidden fruit, and received the said threatned punishment. III. Expounding Gal. 3.10. and proving that the curse therein threatned must not be understood of the curse of the said covenant of nature, but of that curse that is threatned in the covenant of grace to the fallen posterity of Adam, for their not doing of Moses law by faith in Christ, which was given to them for the covenant of grace and reconciliation only. ...

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ny one that hath but read Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Book of Chriſts Sufferings, (in Anſwer to my Book of the meritorious price of mans Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption) may ſoon ſee that I have a neceſſary Calling to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thoſe bleſſed Truths from his charge of Hereſie which he, in his ſaid Anſwer hath caſt upon it.</p>
            <p>I printed a Reply to him in the beginning of <hi>An.</hi> 1655. but then through ſome neceſſary haſt in ſetting out that Reply, I did not ſo fully reply to ſome Particulars as I deſired: and from that time till now I have waited to ſee what further Anſwer he was able to give to my ſaid Reply (of the <hi>Meritorious Price of mans Redemption,)</hi> for the better proving of his ſaid charges.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing in all theſe ſix years time, I do not hear of any further Anſwer from him: and, 2. Seeing he hath builded the whole weight of his Anſwer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that kind of death that is threatned in the Covenant of Nature, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. as undergone by Chriſt, the Surety of the Elect, for their Redemption: I have in this Book enlarged my former Expoſition of that kind of Death, by a more through examination of the true ſenſe of it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. And, 3. Seeing he makes the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to comprehend three diſtinct and differing ſorts or kinds of Laws, and to comprehend two diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nct and differing ſorts or kinds of Covenants, (and ſeeing he doth upon theſe fictitious foundations build the great point of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and the great point of a ſinners Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) I have in this Book enlarged my former Reply, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thoſe different Laws and Covenants: And, 4. Seeing
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. is the Foundation-Scripture wherein the Covenant of Reconciliation was firſt declared, and unto which only the Church had relation for 2083 years (when this promiſe was again renewed unto
<hi>Abraham)</hi> I have in this Book ſhewed, that it doth from hence neceſſarily follow that all the after Scriptures which ſpeak of the Sufferings and of the Death of Chriſt, muſt be referred to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
15. as to their Standard, for their true ſenſe and meaning: and therefore I have in that reſpect made a more particular ſearch and examination into the true ſenſe of every word of that Text: And, 5. I have alſo vindicated ſundry other Scriptures from his unſound ſenſe, by a true Expoſition of them from the Context. And, 6. I have given the Reader a more full Information of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Bleſſed Truths.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſeth in one of his Epiſtles to <hi>Stampitius,</hi> that he had rather be accounted any thing, than to be accuſed of wicked ſilence in Gods cauſe, <hi>Let me,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>be accounted proud, covetous, yea a Murderer, yea guilty of all vices, ſo I be not proved to be guilty of wicked ſilence, whilſt the Lord and his Cauſe ſuffer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34410:3"/> 3. The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> told the Godly in his time (in <hi>verſe</hi> 3.) that it was <hi>needful to write unto them, and to exhort them to contend earneſtly for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints.</hi> Which Faith, (in the former part of the verſe) is called
<hi>the common Salvation,</hi> or, the common Faith, in <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 4. to diſtinguiſh it from that unſound way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which was taught by the falſe Apoſtles: For they taught that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles could not be ſaved by Faith (in Chriſt) alone; unleſs they did joyn thereunto the works of the Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1, &amp;c. But the Apoſtles did teach, that Faith in Chriſt alone, without the works of the Law, was the only condition that God in his Covenant of Grace did require to be performed on their part, for their perfect Juſtification from ſin to life; and thereupon the Apoſtle doth exhort them, to contend earneſtly for this common Faith that was once delivered to (their Forefathers) the Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jeſus Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. But yet in <hi>v.</hi> 19. the Apoſtle hath affixed this Caveat, <hi>Let every man take heed how he buildeth thereon;</hi> for even the Elect themſelves (through Satans ſubtilty and their own weakneſs) do oftentimes build falſe Tenents up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Foundation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P. Martyr</hi> ſaith, That true Doctrine is compared to moſt noble and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things (namely, to Gold, Silver, and precious Stones) And on the other ſide (ſaith he) they that build Wood, Hay, and Straw, declare that Chriſt who is the Foundation, is more or leſs disfigured and diſhonoured by ſtrange Doctrines.</p>
            <p>But I intreat the Reader to remember, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of ſuch Builders only, as hold firm to Chriſt, the Foundation<hi>:</hi> And ſo ſaith <hi>P. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> here only (in
<hi>v.</hi> 12.) is intreated of thoſe Builders which have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Foundation, though they build Wood, Hay, and Stubble, which are unſound Opinions; and ſaith he, in <hi>Com. pl. p.</hi> 241. ſeeing Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Wood, Hay and Stubble are ſpoken of by way of Allegory; there is no doubt but that fire alſo (ſpoken of in <hi>v.</hi> 13.) is to be underſtood in the like allegorical ſenſe, namely, for the trial of the true ſenſe of all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines by the bleſſed Scriptures rightly expounded: and therefore, ſaith he, it is not ſufficient that Doctrines ſhould be tried by the Judgment of men, but by the fire and by the day-light of a divine examination, which is a clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, and a certain trial, whereby at length the truth of Doctrines, and alſo the guilefulneſs of them is made known; for it is the property of fire to make trial what is pure mettal, and what is Droſs: And (ſaith he) from this fire no Builder is exempted, whether he hath builded well or ill; all muſt be proved by the ſame: And (ſaith he) thoſe things which are corruptly taught, cannot alwaies be hidden, for <hi>there is nothing hidden that ſhall not be revealed,</hi> Mat. 10. 26. And although ſuch Tenents as are corrupt, are not preſently made manifeſt, yet as the Light of the day cometh on, they ſhall be made manifeſt; and this (ſaith he) we may ſee to be true by experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many bleſſed Truths are now brought to light, that have lien hid for many years paſt.</p>
            <p>The thing I aim at, is this, That by Builders, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not mean ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as do build ſound Doctrines, but unſound Doctrines alſo upon Chriſt the
<pb facs="tcp:34410:3"/> Foundation, and yet nevertheleſs that they ſhall be ſaved, becauſe they do in the main matter of Faith reſt upon Chriſt the Foundation; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at length they ſhall, by the purifying fire, and by the day-light of Gods Word, perceive, that their unſound Tenents are confuted and condemned; or elſe in caſe they die before they diſcern it, God will accept of their general Repentance for all their ignorances, to the ſaving of their Souls; and ſo ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>v.</hi> 15.
<hi>If any mans work</hi> (of building unſound Tenents upon Chriſt)
<hi>ſhall be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer loſs, but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations, I do not think it meet to thunder out the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of damnable Hereſie upon Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> heterodoxal Tenents, as he doth upon my ſound Scripture Tenents (in <hi>p.</hi> 13. and in <hi>p.</hi> 267. and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.) Though I could cite ſeveral Orthodox Authors that do roundly and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily call his grand Tenent (of Chriſts ſuffering the Torments of hell) Hereſie. 2. Neither can I from the ſaid conſiderations approve of the harſh cenſures of ſome godly Miniſters and others, that do reproach ſuch as do hold ſome unſound Doctrines with the odious name of Hereſie; ſeeing many godly Martyrs have lived and died in ſeveral unſound Tenents; for <hi>here we know but in part, and propheſie but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 9, 13. and yet nevertheleſs ſuch are eternally ſaved, becauſe they do by Faith build their ſalvation upon Chriſt the Foundation: We ought therefore to have two eyes in our head, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not only what is to be deſired touching Uniformity in the ſeveral Points of Faith, but alſo what is attainable in relation to miſled Chriſtians; ſeeing there have ever been, and ever will be differences in Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the godly in ſeveral Particulars; as for example;</p>
            <p n="1">1. When Chriſt told his Diſciples, that he muſt go to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer many things of the Scribes and Elders, and that he muſt be put to death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 20. <hi>Peter</hi> did then hold a contrary Opinion to this fundamental Truth, and from his erroneous Judgment he rebuked Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>Be it far from thee Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee:</hi> But in caſe <hi>Peter</hi> had but rightly underſtood the true ſenſe and meaning of Gods declared Combat of Chriſts ſufferings in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. or in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. or in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. (as <hi>Simeon</hi> did in <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 34. 35.) he would not have oppoſed, but would have much approved of this bleſſed Truth which Chriſt propounded to them: But it ſeemeth that <hi>Peter</hi> did not underſtand the true ſenſe of the ſaid places, to ſpeak of the Sufferings and of the death of Chriſt from the Devils potent Seed; and yet Chriſt did not call his fundamental Errour a Damnable Hereſie, nor yet give him any ſuch like odious term.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Preſently after the dayes of the Apoſtles, there were ſo many Errours broached, that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> one of the ancient Fathers did write a Book againſt the ſeveral Hereſies of thoſe times, and yet himſelf was much miſtaken in ſome of his Cenſures; for he doth cenſure ſome Orthodox Truths to be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as it is noted by Mr.

               </gap>lent Hereticks or Sectaries.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (and ſeveral others of the ancient Divines) held two ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal places; into the uppermoſt of which they held that the Souls of the Saints did go, and ſhould there abide until the time of the Reſurrection, and that after that, they ſhould come to the ſight of God; this is obſerved by <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> in <hi>Com. pl. p.</hi> 374. and in <hi>p.</hi> 243. he affirmeth alſo that the greateſt part of the ancient Divines were enclined to this Opinion, and that there is a Purgatory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> held another groſſe errour, namely that Faith ſhall continue in Heaven, and in <hi>lib.</hi> 5. that Faith and hope do remain after this life; this is alſo noted out of him by
<hi>Carlile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. He held another great errour, namely, that Chriſt lived upon earth until near 50 years; this is alſo noted by the <hi>poor mans Library,</hi> fol. 124.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> ſaith, that in ancient time there have been many Chriſtians which have thought that the (terreſtrial) creatures ſhould remain after the coming of the Lord, and that they ſhall ſerve for ſome uſe unto the Elect; and that when Chriſt ſhall return, there ſhall only be the Reſurrection of the godly, which they call the firſt Reſurrection; between the which, and the latter Reſurrection, when the wicked ſhall be raiſed, there ſhall be the ſpace of
<pb facs="tcp:34410:4"/> a thouſand years; and that during this time, Chriſt ſhall wholly reign in this world together with the Saints, and that in all this ſpace the Devil ſhall be bound, as it is deſcribed in
<hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. 3, &amp;c. And this opinion (ſaith he) was received not only of the common ſort, but even of the principal and moſt eminent in the Church; and this Opinion for the ſubſtance of it, is held by many godly perſons even to this day.</p>
            <p>This Tenent, though I conceive it is a great Errour, yet I do not like that <hi>P. Martyr</hi> and others ſhould cenſure ſuch to be Hereticks, that hold it, as he doth, in <hi>com. pl.</hi> part 4. <hi>p.</hi>
51. and in other places, ſeeing it is found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that many godly perſons do hold it; though I do alſo perceive that they are not uniform in that Opinion, but do differ from one another in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain particulars, as they did alſo in ancient time: For it is obſerved by <hi>Vines,</hi> in his
<hi>Annot.</hi> on the <hi>City of God,</hi> l. 20. c. 7. that all Sects did not agree in one, as touching this 1000 years, but each one taught that which ſeemed likelieſt to himſelf, and no wonder (ſaith he) in ſo vain a fiction.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Though <hi>Cyprian</hi> died a godly Martyr, yet he alſo held many groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours<hi>:</hi> For, 1. He held the Doctrine of Rebaptizing, and which is worſe, he held free-will to good; and alſo that Penance made ſatisfaction to God for ſin; for he ſaith in one of his Sermons, that the Lord muſt be appeaſed and pacified through our ſatisfaction, namely, by open Confeſſion and Repentance; and he alſo held that there is no hope of pardon left him that doth offend after he hath once known God; and yet he doth alſo profeſs, that he would not bear malice againſt any man that was of another Judgment. This was a brave Reſolution in him, and I heartily wiſh that this Chriſtian Reſolution might find the like ready entertainment in the minds of all godly Miniſters and other Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> wrote a Book againſt 80 Hereſies (it ſeems the world did ſwarm with more Hereſies then, than now, in our dayes) and he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confute and refell thoſe Hereſies; and yet himſelf was much addicted to ſome ſuperſtitious traditions; for he affirmed that it was a Conſtitution of the Apoſtles alwaies to faſt, Pentecoſt only excepted, and that ſix dayes before Eaſter, men ſhould eat no other thing than Bread, Salt and Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Several others of the ancient Divines did alſo write againſt the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of their times, and yet themſelves did alſo hold ſundry Errours: But for brevities ſake I will omit them, and come to
<hi>Luthers</hi> dayes: for he ſaith in his Preface to the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> I have been now in the Miniſtry of Chriſt about 20 years, and I can truly witneſs that I have been affailed with more than 20 Sects; but becauſe he doth not name them, I cannot judge of them; and therefore I dare not believe that all thoſe 20 Sects were damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, nor yet that all their Tenents were hereſies; neither yet was
<hi>Luther</hi> himſelf free from ſome groſs Errours; for he held a kind of perſonal union between Chriſt and the godly, and from that Union he made Chriſt to be guilty of all the ſins of the godly; and upon that erroneous Foundation he makes Chriſt to be the greateſt ſinner in the world, as I have ſhewed it more at large in this Book; and I believe that none are free from ſome groſſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or other that are moſt ſevere in cenſuring the Errours of others.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I find in the Book of Martyrs and in other Church-Hiſtories, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb facs="tcp:34410:5"/> Martyrs have died not only in different, but alſo in contradictory Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Dr. <hi>Barnes</hi> the Martyr held againſt the Morality of the Lords Day, he held that every day ought to be as a Sabbath to Chriſtians (contrary to other Martyrs) and good <hi>Calvin</hi> was not far off from that bad opinion. 2. Others of the Martyrs held againſt Infant-Baptiſm, contrary to others; and other unſound Tenents were held by others, as the Articles that are recorded againſt them, and their Anſwers thereunto do witneſs; and yet theſe Martyrs were everlaſtingly ſaved, becauſe they believed in Chriſt the Foundation of their Salvation: Therefore it can be no leſs than a very unchriſtian cenſure to call ſuch as do now hold the ſame or the like differing Tenents damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or to call thoſe Tenents Hereſie; I rather think that ſuch harſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers ſhould account it their happineſs if they could attain to ſuch a lively and operative Faith as many of them have attained to.</p>
            <p n="12">12. When <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> was accuſed of many hereſies by the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> he pleaded, that many times the moſt learned and wiſeſt men in the world, in matter of Faith were of divers opinions, not, ſaid he, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Faith, but to find out the Truth: And, ſaith he, <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> diſſented, and contradicted each other in divers things without any ſuſpition of hereſie: and I do alſo find that although
<hi>Auſtin</hi> diſſented from <hi>Jerom,</hi> yet he was united to him in brotherly and in Chriſtian affections; for he ſaith thus unto
<hi>Jerom,</hi> in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 19. I reckon, my Brother that you would not have us read your Books as if they were written by the Apoſtles and Prophets.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, I cannot but wonder at the ſharp cenſures of ſome godly ones againſt others that differ in ſome Particulars from them, ſeeing they are builders together with us by faith on Chriſt the foundation of their and our ſalvation. I think it is an unchriſtian behaviour to be ſo violently tranſported with paſſion as ſome are at ſuch differences, as if ſome new and ſtrange thing had befallen unto this generation that never did befal any other generation before this; ſeeing I have made it evident that it hath ever been, and ever will be the condition of the Church here in this world to have ſuch as will differ from others in ſome point of Faith or other.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Apoſtle doth tell us that there muſt be alſo Hereſies (or rather Sects) among you, <hi>that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 19. namely, that their Graces (and not their harſh cenſures) may be made manifeſt by trial from others Errours.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The perſons of the godly ought to be loved, though their Errours ought to be wiſely confuted; but yet I ſee that many times Chriſtian Love to ſuch perſons, is extreamly eclipſed, through their deteſtation of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: I confeſs that boſom Love cannot be well ſhewed to ſuch as are of an oppoſite Judgment; yet ſuch a degree of Love muſt rule over diſpleaſed paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as may evidence that we are the children of God by extending ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Love to all ſuch as are begotten of God to believe in Chriſt. M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> ſaith on Tentations, <hi>part</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 28. That Chriſtians may be ſaid to love all true Chriſtians, albeit they do not only forſake ſome particular Chriſtians for a time, but in a fit perſecute them too; and, ſaith he, two particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations may ſeparate each from other, and refuſe Communion one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and yet be both the Churches of Chriſt: So I have read, and hold
<pb facs="tcp:34410:5"/> it to be true, that in the ancient Church there fell out bitter Conflicts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Chryſoſtom, Theophilus, Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and yet no wiſe man dare queſtion, but that they were all four the moſt excellent ſervants of God; and (ſaith he) one would think the Priſon ſhould reconcile all betwixt good men; yet we read that one <hi>Miletius</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame priſon for the ſame cauſe, upon a ſlight and light matter fell into ſuch a fit, that they refuſed to hold communion one with another, and yet both very good men, and both ſuffered Martyrdom for the Chriſtian Faith; but yet I ſay alſo that the Devil laughes in his ſleeve when he can prevail ſo far, as to make ſuch diſtances of Affection between the godly; and therefore it is to be lamented that ſuch diſtances are ſo much cheriſhed and practiſed by ſuch as profeſs the ſame Faith in Chriſt for ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="14">14. I do delieve that the word <hi>Heretick</hi> and
<hi>Hereſie</hi> is not ſo clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by many that do commonly uſe it (as it ought to be) in deteſtation of many errours: Mr.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> ſaith in <hi>Judges,</hi> fol. 58.

            <p>From theſe and many ſuch like Conſiderations, which I might add if need required, it is evident that the ſaid Objection made from Novelty is of no force to contemn ſuch Expoſitions as are grounded on the true ſenſe of the Context; and therefore I may ſay as <hi>Bro.</hi> doth; It is no fault to differ from all Churches for the good of all Churches: For Churches (ſaith he) do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no ſway above the Word of God, but the Word of God (rightly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) above all Churches.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The Apoſtle ſaith unto me, and unto all that fear God, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Titus, Speak thou the things which become ſound Doctrine</hi> (Tit. 2. 1.) <hi>ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncorruptneſs, gravity, ſincerity, ſound ſpeech, that cannot be condemned, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no evil thing to ſay of you,</hi> Tit. 2. 7, 8. In this Treatiſe I have as near as I can, followed the Apoſtles Directions; therefore I adviſe the Reader not to condemn the whole or any part thereof before due trial.</p>
            <p n="18">18. My main ſcope in this Treatiſe is to vindicate the true ſenſe of the word <hi>Death,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. and of ſundry other Scriptures alſo, from the great Errours that are held forth in Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> Anſwer. But in caſe any Reader will be pleaſed to make obſervations of any Errours they find in this Reply, I ſhall account it a Chriſtian kindneſs to adviſe me of it; that ſo I may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it anew, and amend it as there may be cauſe; or if it pleaſeth M.
<hi>Norton</hi> or any other to print any thing in way of confutation, I ſhall rejoyce at it, provided it be done to the advantage of the Truth; yea I ſhall kiſs his lips that giveth a right Anſwer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 26.
<hi>yea my reins ſhall rejoyce when thy lips ſpeak right things,</hi> Prov.
23. 16. For if I know mine own heart, I deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as that the Truth may be advanced, though I be vilified: But yet I cannot think that any curſory Readers can undertake this Task; it is too laborious for ſuch Readers: therefore if any thing be done to any good purpoſe, it muſt come from ſuch only as will take the pains of the mind in a more than ordinary ſerious manner, to examine things throughly from the true ſenſe of the bleſſed Scriptures: The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>The heart of the Righteous will ſtudy to anſwer,</hi> Prov. 15. 28. And <hi>Job</hi> makes this Reply to his zealous Confuters, <hi>Ye comfort me in vain, ſeeing in your Anſwers there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Falſhood,</hi> or <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Job 21.
34.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Or in caſe the Reader cannot or will not take the ſaid pains of the mind, then my deſire in the next place is, that they will be pleaſed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace what they judge to be ſound and good, and to paſs by the reſt: This Adviſe was formerly given by <hi>Baſil</hi> to the Readers of his time: We muſt (ſaith he) be partakers of other mens Sayings wholly after the manner of the Bees; for they fly not alike to all Flowers, neither where they ſit, do they crop them quite away, but ſnatching ſo much as ſhall ſuffice for their honey-making,
<pb facs="tcp:34410:7"/> take their leave of the reſt: Even ſo we, if we be wiſe (ſaith he) having got out of others ſo much as is ſound, and agreeable to the Truth, will leap over the reſt; which Rule (ſaith he) if we keep in alledging the words of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (or others) we ſhall not ſwerve from our (Chriſtian) profeſſion, and the Scripture ſhall have the Soveraign place, and yet the Doctors of the Church ſhall loſe no part of their due eſtimation.</p>
            <p>Theſe Cautions and Conſiderations being well obſerved, will benefit the godly Reader, and I hope alſo the Church of God; to the preſerving of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Affection, and Unity among them: eſpecially in the ſubſtance of the Faith, though they are and ever will be of differing Judgments in ſome Particulars, as long as we live here; becauſe as long as we live here, we <hi>know but in part, and propheſie but in part,</hi> 1 Cor.
13. 9, 12. And ſo I reſt,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aſter <hi>Norton</hi> doth expound the Death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. of three ſeveral kinds of Death, in <hi>pag.</hi> 21. 22. his
<note place="margin">One and the ſame word in one and the ſame Text, can have no more but one proper ſence in that place.</note> threefold expoſition I finde to be exceeding erroneous: For, 1.

                  </gap>ſon</hi> in his Theological Rules, for the right underſtanding of the Scripture, ſaith in his 41. and
131. Rules, that every Scripture hath but one certain and fit meaning, which by all means is to be ſearched after, and reſted in. 2. Saith he, all interpretations muſt be fit as well as true; for one place of Scripture can have but one fit and proper interpretation, which is very hard ſometimes to hit upon.</p>
            <p>This precious rule of a right expoſition Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth approve, (though yet he doth alſo tranſgreſs it, in his expoſition of the word Death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.) 1. He doth approve it, and doth alſo make uſe of it to confute a ſhort paſſage in my Dialogue, becauſe I do therein give two ſeveral ſences of the word Death in
<hi>Ebr.</hi> 5. 7. Firſt, that Chirſt doth there pray to be delivered from his natural fear of death; and this expoſition I believe is ſound and good, and accordeth to the true meaning of the word Death in that Text: and this expoſition I did chiefly inſiſt upon: but yet 2. I ſaid alſo, that Chriſt did there pray to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the dominion of death by his Reſurrection: and this expoſition is alſo given by <hi>Haymo</hi> in
<hi>Ebr.</hi> 5. 7. and it is ſound Doctrine in it ſelf, and it is no more but three lines that I ſpeak of it: and yet by the ſaid rule of a ſound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, (cited there by Mr. <hi>Norton)</hi> I do freely confeſs, that both my expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word Death in that Text, cannot be there meant: and therefore my laſt expoſition muſt be removed from <hi>Ebr.</hi> 5. 7. and placed in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 24, 27. where it is moſt fit and ſutable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:34410:10"/> But O that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> had been ſo happy as to have kept cloſe to this appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rule in his expoſition of the word Death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. but alas he hath moſt inconſiderately tranſgreſſed it: for in his Book of Chriſts Sufferings he hath in
<hi>pag.</hi> 21. expounded it of three ſeveral ſorts of Death, in three differing proper ſences. 1. Of a bodily Death. 2. Of a ſpiritual Death in ſin, and 3. Of an eternal Death in Hell.</p>
            <p>But in caſe the ſaid received maxim be a ſound rule of a right expoſition, (as I believe it is) then his ſaid three diſtinct ſorts and kindes of Death cannot be comprehended under the word Death in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. ſeeing they differ from each other, not onely in degree (as many unlimited words may do in the ſame Text) but in kinde, becauſe they do ariſe from two ſeveral threatnings, from two ſeveral and oppoſite covenants: for 1. the Death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. doth ariſe from the Covenant of nature onely; and it is no other but a double kind of Spiritual Death, as I have opened the matter more at large in <hi>Sect.</hi>
2. and 3. But the Death of the body, and the eternal Death of the ſoul and body in Hell, do ariſe from the threatning of the Covenant of Grace onely: namely, after it was firſt declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. then a bodily Death was firſt threatned in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. to all the fallen Sons of
<hi>Adam,</hi> as a puniſhment for Original ſin: and then an eternal Death in Hell doth follow to all that live and die without faith in the ſeed of the Woman for their redemption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſaid expoſition of three diſtinct ſorts of Death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.
<note place="margin">The death threatned in the Covenant of nature muſt not he expounded in any larger ſence, then is intended by that Covenant.</note> is alſo contrary to another precious rule of a ſound expoſition, which Mr. <hi>Hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kis</hi> doth give in his Exercitation,
<hi>pag.</hi> 21. we muſt (ſaith he) beware that we do not in our conceptions about Scripture (words and) phraſes <hi>ſupraſentire,</hi> not underſtand more in them then what is fit, or in reaſon is poſſible to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. We muſt be careful (ſaith he) not to ſence them above their ſcope and intendment: for when they are over ſenced, they are no part of Scripture, but of his erroneous conceptions that doth over-ſenſe them: and therefore I adde that ſeeing the Death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi>
2. 17. is confined to the Covenant of nature onely, it ought not to be expounded in any larger ſence then is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by that Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> doth alſo give this very ſame rule of a right expoſition in his <hi>Com. pl. p.</hi> 108. namely, that ſentences of Scripture muſt not be more largely underſtood, then the place it ſelf wherein they are written may bear<hi>:</hi> for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (ſaith he) we may be ſoon led into error. This precious rule of a right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is the more ſtrictly to be urged and obſerved, becauſe it is too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly tranſgreſſed by many Interpreters, who do labour to graſpe in as many ſences as they can, into the ſame word of the ſame Text, to the utter confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the true ſence of that place; and therefore the ſaid rule doth adviſe the prudent Expoſitor, to beware that he doth not expound the word Death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. in any larger ſence then is intended by the threatning of the Covenant of nature; eſpecially ſeeing I have ſhewed in <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. and elſewhere, that that Covenant reacheth no further in its promiſe and threatning, then either to a happy natural life, or to a miſerable kinde of a double ſpiritual death in this world onely, without any bodily death: and from thence it follows, that the ſaid threatning of the Covenant of nature cannot camprehend under it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a bodily death, nor yet an eternal death in Hell: and therefore thoſe two
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34410:10"/> ſorts of death were not threatned, until after the Covenant of grace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation was firſt declared in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. but then as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the faith by that declaration. A bodily death was firſt threatned in
<hi>verſ.</hi> 19. as the proper puniſhment of the ſecond ſort of
<hi>Adams</hi> ſin, now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Original ſin in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
12. or Inhabiting ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. 20. And then 2. When God did firſt threaten a bodily death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. he did together
<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19. Ebr. 9. 27.</note> with it appoint a particular day of Judgement to follow it, to each departed ſoul (in relation to the new Covenant of reconciliation) as the Apoſtle doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us in
<hi>Ebr.</hi> 9. 27. He there tells us, that it is appointed unto men once to die, and after that the Judgement <hi>(i.e.)</hi> unto ſuch as die in the faith of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, by the promiſed ſeed of the Woman, a judgement to an eternal life in Heaven<hi>:</hi> but to all the reſt that die in the unbelief thereof, a judgement to an eternal death in Hell. And from thence it followes, that it can be no leſs then a foundation errour in Mr.
<hi>Norton,</hi> to build his whole book of Chriſts ſufferings, upon the threatning of that kinde of death that is threatned in the Covenant of nature onely, ſeeing that Covenant is totally extinguiſhed; and ſeeing when it was in being, it threatned no other kinde of death, but a double kinde of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual death onely. 1. By deprivation, and 2. By corruption of nature, as I ſhall declare it more at large by and by.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> expoſition of the word Death in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. to be meant of
<note place="margin">Both Scripture and reaſon doth ſometimes teach us to reſtrain the ſence of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral words, to the proper ſence of the place where they are uſed.</note> three diſtinct ſorts and kinds of death, is contrary to another moſt precious rule of a right expoſition, given by Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in his preface to <hi>Geneſis</hi> in
<hi>pag.</hi> 4. In our expounding of the Oracles of God, (ſaith he) we are taught to take ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and indefinite ſpeeches in the largeſt ſence, unleſs there be ſome ſpecial reaſon of reſtraint. This caution of reſtraint is of ſpecial conſideration to guide Expoſitors in their expoſition of ſundry words, and in particular in the right ſence of that kinde of death, that was threatned in the Covenant of nature in <hi>Gen.</hi>
2. 17. for though that word be indefinite in it ſelf, yet in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
17. (and in ſundry other Scriptures) reaſons from the context doth teach us to reſtrain it to that kinde of death that is threatned in the Covenant of nature onely.</p>
            <p>From the premiſes I infer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the word Death cannot in any one text of the Bible be expounded of all the ſaid three ſorts of Death in a proper ſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That no other Scripture doth threaten the ſaid double kinde of ſpiritual death to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all his natural poſterity, but <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. onely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That no one Scripture that is not typical, doth in a proper ſence threaten both a bodily death, and an eternal death in Hell, but the one properly, and the other by conſequence onely: as for example, God threatned <hi>Elies</hi> Houſe with ſome untimely death or other, 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 29, 30, 31. and he did alſo confirm his
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 14.</note> threatning with his unalterable Oath, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 14. and this threatning was an unlimited and a definitive threatning; and yet for all that God did not by that death threaten them with an eternal death in Hell, for their preſumptuous ſins: but upon their unfeigned repentance he would free them from an eternal death in Hell, as it is alſo well obſerved by our Annotat. in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. And on the other hand, when an eternal death in Hell is threatned in a proper ſence, as it is in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20. and <hi>Ezek</hi> 18. 20,
21, 23, 24, 26, 31, 32. <hi>John</hi> 8. 51. there a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34410:11"/> bodily death is not then properly threatned; but by conſequence onely from the firſt general threatning in <hi>Gen.</hi>
3. 19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. My aboveſaid three rules of a right expoſition, do not onely confute and confound Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſaid expoſition of three ſences and kindes of death to be threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. but they do alſo confute and confound his threeſold expoſition of the word Law at Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> for he doth expound it of three differing ſorts and kindes of Laws, and of two differing and oppoſite ſorts of Covenants, quite contrary to the ſaid approved rules of a right expoſition: and for the further confutation of which, ſee my replies in <hi>chap.</hi> 5. and in
<hi>chap.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="5">5. My ſaid three rules of a right expoſition, do alſo confute his twofold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the word, <hi>her Seed,</hi> in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. for he doth expound it: 1. To ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Chriſt, and 2. To ſignifie all the Godly; both which, ſaith he, are the ſeed of
<hi>Eve.</hi> But for the confutation thereof, ſee my expoſition of
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. in <hi>chap.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For want of obſerving the ſaid rules of a right expoſition, he hath miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the word <hi>Sheol</hi> and
<hi>Hades</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 1. To ſignifie the grave to Chriſt: Body, and 2. To ſignifie Hell torments to his ſoul, as I have ſhewed it alſo in my former Printed reply, <hi>pag.</hi> 109. and divers other words he hath over ſenced, as the word <hi>Anazed,</hi> in <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 33,

            <p>Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> expoſition of the word Death in

            <p n="2">2. Though Original ſin did reign over our firſt parents, (as ſoon as ever God had deprived them of his concreated image) for their firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit, yet a bodily death did not immediately follow from thence by a natural neceſſity: but in Gods time it followed from Gods ſpecial appointment; and it was the good pleaſure of God to delay the appointment of it, until he had firſt declared his new Covenant of grace and reconciliation in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. by which declaration
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were converted, and God was reconciled,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15. 19.</note> by the undertaking of the ſeed of the Woman: and then it was the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God to threaten a bodily death in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. as a common puniſhment for Original ſin, to all <hi>Adams</hi> natural poſterity, as I have ſhewed it more at large in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. at <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. and elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

<hi>unto eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> and to this ſence doth the context direct us to underſtand this reigning power of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs through grace, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. 16. namely, of the free gift (of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs) of many offences to juſtification; and this juſtification from ſin is alſo called the juſtification of life, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. as it is alſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> ſaith, that in juſtification there is a right given to deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from puniſhment, (which is the <hi>terminus a que)</hi> in which reſpect (ſaith

            <p>From the premiſes then I conclude, that neither of theſe two Scriptures do prove that God did threaten the three ſaid diſtinct kindes and ſorts of death in the Covenant of nature, to all <hi>Adams</hi> natural poſterity alike; as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth moſt erroneouſly make them to ſpeak.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The deprivation of Gods concreated image, and likewiſe in moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: and this deprivation is that which is moſt properly (and in the firſt place) called death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. And this deprivation was Gods act, namely,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34410:13"/> it was the immediate act of his juſtice, which he inflicted on <hi>Adam</hi> as a proper poenal puniſhment for his firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit.

17. <hi>hath two parts; and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it may be fitly called a twofold Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death; and ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in caſe</hi> Adam <hi>had but firſt eaten of the tree of Life, he ſhould have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in a twofold natural life: as in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi> 23.</note> it were not, and becauſe it ceaſed to be in reſpect of righteouſneſs and fellowſhip with God. And indeed (ſaith he) this is the death of all deaths, when the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſubſiſtence and being, and yet is deprived of all comfortable fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God. And ſaith <hi>Cyril,</hi> that is not properly death which ſevereth the ſoul from the body, but that which ſevereth the ſoul from God; and therefore he that is ſeparated from God is dead. This aſſertion of his is true, not onely in relation to the ſeparation of the ſoul from God in Hell, but tis as true alſo in relation to <hi>Adams</hi> firſt death, when his ſoul was deprived of Gods concreated image.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt part of that Spiritual death that was threatned in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of nature onely; and this firſt part is no where elſe expreſly called death in any other Scripture, but in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
17. onely. And 2. This part muſt not be called death in ſin: for Gods act was pure juſtice, and no ſin was in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of that death that was threatned in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. as it is in the conſequent of the firſt part, <hi>[Is called Death in Sin.]</hi> This ſecond part was not inflicted from the immediate hand of God, as the firſt part was, but it did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow it, as an accident to it. For as ſoon as God had deprived
<hi>Adam</hi> of his concreated image of moral perfections, which God had annexed to his immortal ſoul in his creation, as an accident to its ſubject, for the rectitude of his whole man, in a perfect conformity to the moral Law of his nature, <hi>Adam</hi> (from this deficient cauſe) could not otherwiſe chooſe, but inſtantly act irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly againſt every branch of his ſaid concreated moral principles: and this ſinning quality of his will is that which is now <hi>[called Death in ſin]</hi> but it is moſt commonly called Original ſin, and by <hi>Paul</hi> it is called Inhabiting ſin, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17, 20.</p>
            <p>And this matter of Original ſin doth continually dwell in us, and paſſeth
<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 17, 20. <hi>The matter of Original ſin paſſeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as the matter of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſin doth. And yet though actual ſin hath no phyſical or natural exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, after it is committed it hath a moral exiſtence by its guilt or deſert of puniſhment.</hi>
               </note> not away as long as we live in this world, as the matter of actual ſin doth, as it is rightly obſerved by <hi>P.

For this Original ſin doth make every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart to be onely evil, and that continually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. But ſaith <hi>P. Martyr</hi> in
<hi>pag.</hi> 233. At the time of death this kinde of ſin ſhall altogether be aboliſhed; for in the bleſſed reſurrection we ſhall have a new made body, made fit for eternal felicity.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> two forecited Scriptures do agree to this ſecond part of our Spiritual death in ſin; but they do not at all agree to the firſt part: and thence it followes, that they are no proofs of the whole of this death which was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. they are no more but half proofs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence it followes, that in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> could have kept himſelf from any further ſinning againſt the moral Law of his nature, after he had tranſgreſſed the poſitive Law of the Covenant of nature, he ſhould never have ſuffered any other kinde of death, but the firſt part of his Spiritual death onely. But as I have ſhewed, he being deprived of Gods concreated image, (for his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34410:13"/> of the Covenant of nature) could not after that keep himſelf from further ſinning againſt the moral Law of his nature: but his blinded will being of an active nature, was like a blinde Horſe that is full of mettle, which made him run continually into dangerous act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. He declared the perſon that ſhould come from the ſeed of the Woman.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He declared the manner how he ſhould break the Devils head-plot for mans redemption, and that he expreſſed to be by his performing of a warlike combate with his envious combater Satan, in performing of obedience to the articles of the combate, until he had made his death to be accepted as a moſt pleaſing ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, even at the ſame time when the Devil had a liberty of power given him, to pierce him in the footſoles as a ſinful Malefactor on the Croſs: and from hence it comes to paſs, that as many of the fallen poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> as ſhall at any time believe in this ſeed of the Woman, for the procuring of their ſaid redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, ſhall be regenerated and have a new nature while they live in this world; and by that means all the ſaid three general threatnings ſhall be but corrective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poenal puniſhments unto them. And 2. That when their bodies ſhall come to die, their ſouls ſhall paſs from this life, to live an eternal life in Heaven: But all the reſt of the world, that ſhall live and die in the unbelief of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the ſaid ſeed of the woman, ſhall not onely abide under their ſaid Spiritual death in ſin, without any change, but alſo they ſhall live and die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſanctiſied uſe of the ſaid three general puniſhments; and ſo they ſhall become proper puniſhments unto them. And 2. When they come to die, their ſouls ſhall be judged to an eternal death in Hell. This difference is onely made in the Covenant of grace, but not at all in the Covenant of nature: but in the Covenant of nature the elect are threatned as much as the reprobates, with the ſame puniſhment of a double Spiritual death, without any difference, and that alſo in a way of ſatisfaction to Gods relative juſtice in that Covenant. And this truth I have alſo teſtified in my former printed Reply, in <hi>pag.</hi> 121. where I ſay thus in my Reply to his fourth Argument.</p>
            <p>It is as true as ſalvation it ſelf, that all the elect do in themſelves ſuffer that dreadfull Spiritual death, that was denounced to mans nature in general, in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> the head in that Covenant did tranſgreſs it, by his act of eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit; and that death is the onely eſſential puniſhment that is threatned in that Covenant, as I have there ſhewed it in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though by vertue of the abſolute Covenant of grace, the elect do at one time or other before death, come to have their corrupt nature renewed here, by the grace of regeneration; yet they are not ſo perfectly renewed, (but that their double Spiritual death doth ſtill remain upon them, as a ſatisfaction to Gods relative juſtice in the Covenant of nature) as long as they live in this world; as I noted it a little before from <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> in Reply 7. For in caſe it ſhould be granted, that that vindicative puniſhment might be wholly taken off in this life in regeneration, it would from thence follow, that the threatning of a Spiritual death in the Covenant of nature, was not a definitive threatning:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34410:14"/> but I have elſewhere ſhewed, that it was denounced as an abſolute or definitive threatning to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to all his natural poſterity<hi>:</hi> and therefore that all the regenerate muſt undergo it as well as the unregenerate, as long as they live in this world: and in that reſpect all the regenerate have juſt cauſe to cry out as <hi>Paul</hi> doth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>O ſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In caſe Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> had been ſo happy as to have obſerved the ſaid diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the threatning of the Covenant of nature, and the threatning of the Covenant of grace, (as he ought to have been, before he anſwered my Dialogue, conſidering what hints I gave him of it in my ſaid Dialogue) he might have found, that though God did make a wide difference between the elect

<hi>pag.</hi> 7. And this eſſential puniſhment of deprivation, which is an effect of juſtice, and of the which God was the Author, as himſelf alſo ſaith in <hi>pag.</hi> 8. in depriving <hi>Adam</hi> and all his elect poſterity, as much as his reprobate poſterity of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created

            <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> ſeems to contradict this, becauſe he ſaith in his next words, that the elect ſuffer no part of poenal puniſhment; and yet it ſeems to me, that he doth alſo contradict this aſſertion, for he ſaith in <hi>pag.</hi> 255. that Original ſin is the poenal effect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; <hi>i.e.</hi> it is ſo by conſequent, as I ſhewed before: and thence alſo it followes, that even the elect as well as the reprobates do ſuffer the ſame poenal wrath of God, that was threatned onely in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of nature.

            <p n="2">2 It is another grand error to affirm, (as he doth) that the bodily death of
<note place="margin">The bodily death of Chriſt was not a proper vindicative pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as the death of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats is; neither was it a caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory death, as the death of the elect is, but it was a death of Covenant onely, that ſo it might be performed and accepted as a propitiatory ſacrifice.</note> Chriſt was ſuch a vindicative death, as was threatned to the bodies of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: for in <hi>pag</hi> 22. he makes them both alike in their bodily death, without any difference. It is, ſaith he, a temporal and properly poenal puniſhment in Chriſt; and ſo ſaith he, it is a temporal and properly poenal puniſhment in the reprobates. This odious comparing of the bodily death of Chriſt to the bodily death of reprobates, doth ſtrongly taſte of hereſie in my pallate.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In caſe the bodily death of Chriſt had been inflicted from the vindicative wrath of God, as it is upon reprobates for their inherent ſin, then I wonder how it could be accepted of God as an expiatory ſacrifice, ſeeing it is the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Law of God, that no ſacrifice ſhall be accepted of him, in caſe it have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpot or blemiſh in it. And the ancient <hi>Ebrew</hi> Doctors do tell us, that there are above fifty blemiſhes that did diſable a Lamb from being offered in ſacrifice. See

            <p n="4">4. In caſe the death of Chriſt was inflicted on his body from Gods wrath, as it is upon reprobates as a proper vindicative puniſhment, then I wonder who was the Prieſt in that kinde of death and Sacrifice?

By conſequence to be dead in Original ſin: and therefore to make Chriſts ſoul dead, according to the true meaning of that threatned death, is to make his ſoul dead in ſin, which is the higheſt degree of blaſphemy that can be uttered.

<hi>Mr. Norton</hi> runs into another erroneous expoſition of that threatned death, namely, that Chriſt ſuffered the eſſential torments of Hell in his ſoul, in <hi>pag.</hi> 56. 115, 120, 213 but I have confuted this expoſition of the word Death in my former print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reply, and in this Book alſo, to the which I refer the Reader for further ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>In theſe words Doctor <hi>Uſher</hi> doth make eternity (to be not a circumſtance to Hell torments, as <hi>Mr. Norton</hi> doth but) to be an eſſential property to Hell torments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> doth alſo make eternity to be eſſential to Hell torments<hi>:</hi> It is

            <p n="3">3. Saith <hi>P. Martyr</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 318. if death in Hell be not eternal, it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called death.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Unto this I adde, that the ſeparation between the places of Heaven and Hell is eternal, ſo that they cannot paſs from one to another, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 26.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſoul of man was created to continue immortal after the death of the body; therefore it muſt be continued either in the place of eſſential glory, or in the place of eſſential torment: and thence it followes, that eternity is as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Hell torments, as it is eſſential to glorified ſouls in Heaven. Death in Hell and life in Heaven are both eſſentially eternal, that is to ſay, infinite in length though not in right. But ſeeing <hi>Mr. Norton</hi> doth affirm, that eternity is not eſſential to Hell torments, it is meet that he ſhould ſhew by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſacred Scriptures he doth aſſert it, and not run onely to humane ſimilitudes of impriſoned debtors, as he doth, or elſe he will preſume to know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is written.

            <p n="2">2. Was he at any time under the torment of deſparation?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth thus anſwer in <hi>pag.</hi> 119, 130. As Chriſt was guilty of ſin
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34410:18"/> by his voluntary undertaking thereof as a ſurety, ſo alſo he was ſenſible of an accuſing conſcience: and (ſaith he) Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith, If Chriſt did truly bear our ſins, he ſuſtained alſo the grief of conſcience for them, which is the inſeparable companion of our ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. (Saith he) deſparation is not of the eſſence, but accidental in poenal wrath. But I have confuted this aſſertion, not onely in this place, but alſo in my former printed Reply, in <hi>pag.</hi> 55, 71. and elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I will adde to theſe what Mr. <hi>Weames</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Portraiture, pag.</hi> 214. Chriſt (ſaith he) had no grief of conſcience, which is an adjunct of ſin in the wicked; ſo neither had he deſpair: he agrees with Doctor <hi>Uſher</hi> above cited.

               <p>But no other ſort or kinde of death was ſtrictly executed in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day [or time] in the which <hi>Adam</hi> did firſt taſte of the forbidden fruit, but the ſaid double kinde of Spiritual death onely.</p>

               <p>Theſe ancient writers have given the right ſence of the word Death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. though Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> doth not ſtick to their expoſition: and I do alſo finde, that ſometimes it doth come to paſs, that ſome ancient Orthodox expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are paſſed over, and not ſo well marked as they ought to be; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they give but a brief hint of the true expoſition, or elſe becauſe ſome lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Expoſitors, which are not ſo ſound, are too too commonly received for true; by the means whereof the judgement of others is foreſtalled.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I will adde unto theſe three ancient writers, what Mr. <hi>John Goodwin</hi> ſaith in <hi>Vindiciae Pidei,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi>
104, 105. Upon deeper conſideration (ſaith he) it will happily be found to be nearer the truth to hold, that in theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death:</hi> Gods meaning was not to threaten eternal death, either according to the Letter, or by way of equivalency: but to have the word Death underſtood by <hi>Adam,</hi> as it indifferently ſignifieth that evil of puniſhment, which was repreſented to him by the name Death.</p>

But God had not ordained any repentance in the Covenant of nature, to be performed by <hi>Adam</hi> as the condition on his part, to move God for the <hi>non</hi> execution of his ſaid threatning: and thence it followes, that ſeeing God did not will any ſuch change in <hi>Adam,</hi> that his ſaid threatning was an abſolute definitive threatning, and no way reverſeable; and therefore it was fully and formally executed at the very point of time of that very day in the which he did but taſte of the forbidden fruit.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Daneus</hi> ſaith in <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 9. that the ſentence of God is of two ſorts; the firſt comminatory or of threatning onely, the other difinitive and abſolute<hi>:</hi> this latter, ſaith he, can never be revoked, the former may (by repentance,

               <p>This diſtinction between Gods threatnings or ſentence of puniſhment, makes it is clear as the Sun at noon-day, that the threatning in

               <p n="17">17. This precious rule of certainty, touching Gods definitive threatning in the Covenant of nature, Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth not obſerve, and therefore he doth confound this Covenant, and this threatned Spiritual death, with the other kinds of death that are threatned onely in the Covenant of grace, to the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confuſion of ſundry points of Divinity, and of the true ſence of many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: for he doth affirm in his firſt foundation propoſition, in <hi>pag.</hi> 2. that God did conſtitute Chriſt to be <hi>Adams</hi> ſurety in the Covenant of nature, for two main ends. 1. To do the command of that Covenant in a way of works, (which indeed required no other work, but to eat of the Tree of life in the earthly Paradiſe in the Countrey of <hi>Eden)</hi> and 2. To ſuffer the eſſential puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that curſed death, which was no other but a twofold Spiritual death, as I have explained it in <hi>Reply</hi> 6. and therefore it can be no leſs then blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if it be not Hereſie to affirm that Chriſt was <hi>Adams</hi> ſurety to ſuffer that twofold Spiritual death.</p>
               <p n="18">18. All ſuch as are willing to embrace the truth in the love of it, may ſoon ſee that God hath put none elſe under the threatning of the Covenant of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but <hi>Adam</hi> and his natural generation onely, by <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 5. and thence it followes, that ſeeing Chriſt was none of <hi>Adams</hi> natural generation, he cannot come under the Covenant of nature, as the ſurety of the elect, to do the command, and to ſuffer the curſe of that Covenant for mans redemption: neither is there any redemption at all from the firſt part of the Spiritual death, but even the elect themſelves do ſuffer it as long as they live in this world. And for the fuller confutation of his ſaid heterodoxal tenent, I gave four reaſons in my Dialogue, in <hi>pag.</hi> 5. why Chriſt cannot be our ſurety in the Covenant of nature; and thoſe reaſons ſtand ſtill in their full force, like mount <hi>Sion,</hi> notwithſtanding what Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> hath anſwered, or can anſwer: but when God ſhall enlighten his underſtanding, to diſtinguiſh the Covenant of nature from the Covenant of grace, then, and not till then he will ſee the ſtrength of them. And 2. I have alſo ſhewed in my former printed <hi>Reply,</hi> that Chriſt could not be our ſurety in the Covenant of nature, in <hi>pag.</hi>
86, 150, 152.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word <hi>Surety</hi> in <hi>Ebr.</hi> 7. 22. is applied by the Apoſtle to the everlaſting
<note place="margin">Ebr. 7. 22.</note> Prieſthood of Chriſt, by his interceſſion in Heaven for all believers; and not to the Covenant of nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thing which doth make Chriſt to be an everlaſting ſurety (or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty) for believing ſinners, in Heaven, is Gods unchangeable Oath: for it is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34410:20"/> by that unchangeable Oath that Chriſt is made a ſure, a ſtedfaſt, an unalterable, an unchangeable, and an eternal High Prieſt, even now after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and aſſention into Heaven: for (ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.) this man
<hi>(i.e.</hi> this ſure High Prieſt) becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſthood; wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them for evermore, that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them, <hi>Ebr.</hi> 7. 24, 25. with <hi>Ebr.</hi> 10. 12. See alſo at <hi>Reply</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He was made a Prieſt of a better Teſtament, then the outward typical Teſtament of works was; for that Teſtament which was made onely with the national Church at mount <hi>Sioa,</hi> was confirmed with no other blood but the blood of beaſts onely, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. and thoſe typical Prieſts, and thoſe typical works of the Law, were ordained but to juſtifie their bodies onely, from their ceremonial ſins, by the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean Ewes, did ſanctifie no other ways to the purifying of their fleſh or bodies from their ceremonial ſins. But Chriſt was made a High Prieſt of a better Teſtament, which he alſo confirmed by his own bloody death and ſacrifice, for the purifying of the ſoul or conſcience from moral ſins: and now by his reſurrection and aſſention into Heaven he continues to be a ſure High Prieſt of the better Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Others do expound the word <hi>Surety</hi> in
<hi>Ebr.</hi> 7. 22. that Chriſt as Mediator, did undertake on Gods behalf to perform his Covenant towards us: and 2. That he alſo undertook on mans behalf, that they ſhall perform that obedience which God requires of them in his Covenant of grace. This aſſertion is in it ſelf a moſt precious truth, as it doth ariſe from the word <hi>Mediator:</hi> but this truth doth not ariſe from the word <hi>Surety</hi> in <hi>Ebr.</hi> 7. 22. and therefore I believe that my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer expoſition is moſt agreeable to the true ſence of the word <hi>Surety</hi> in <hi>Ebr.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth all along confound the word
<hi>Surety</hi> of the better Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the meer Covenant of nature made with <hi>Adam,</hi> which was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Teſtament, as the typical Covenant of works was with the Jews; neither is it now in being: but it was totally extinguiſhed as ſoon as it was tranſgreſſed, ſo extreamly heterodox is his expoſition of the word <hi>Surety</hi> in <hi>Ebr.</hi> 2.

               </p>
               <p>It is that peculiar juſtice that God did freely conſtitute for the breach of the
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Law of that Covenant; namely, it was a twofold Spiritual death, as I have opened it before in <hi>Reply</hi>
7. Now the eſſence of a Law doth conſiſt in this, that it is the declared will of the Law-giver, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not his undeclared or ſecret will that determines what ſhall be our duty to do, and what rewards and penalties ſhall be due unto us: but it is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will or law onely.</p>
               <p>Now the threatning that was annexed to his declared Law of the Covenant of nature in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. was an act of Gods good pleaſure, from whence did follow his proceeding with <hi>Adam,</hi> according to that condition which he freely conſtituted between him and <hi>Adam</hi> in that Covenant; namely, that in caſe he did tranſgreſs that arbitrary Law and Covenant, by eating of the forbidden fruit, then in the ſame day or time of his eating, <hi>In dying he ſhould die;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſhould certainly die at that time: and it is certain, that he died no other death at that preſent, but a double Spiritual death. 1. By the loſs of Gods image, and 2. By his new habit of ſinning againſt the Law of his nature; and therefore no other death was threatned by that Law and Covenant.</p>
               <p>What was the ſupreme and firſt cauſe why God did threaten

This kinde of juſtice is peculiar onely to Gods ſupreme will, in his arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Laws and Covenants, in a far differing manner from his relative juſtice in his common moral Laws: for by the juſtice of his common moral Laws, the children might not be put to death for their fathers moral tranſgreſſions, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 16. but by thoſe Laws the particular perſon onely that ſinned was to be put to die.

               <p n="8">8. Tis worthy of all obſervation, that Gods poſitive Laws and Covenants are many times ſo ſtrictly commanded, that they muſt be obeyed, though they do ſometimes command things to be done contrary to the moral Law of nature, or elſe the threatned penalties will be moſt ſtrictly executed: for by the moral Laws of nature <hi>Abraham</hi> was commanded to preſerve his ſons life; but yet God did by his ſupreme poſitive Law command him to kill his ſon for a ſacrifice.</p>

That the ſenſitive life of the body was killed by drowning<hi>:</hi> and 2. that then it cauſed the immortal ſoul to depart from the body to an eternal death in Hell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though the dual number may be called plural, yet doubtleſs there is ever ſome ſpecial reaſon why the dual number is ſo often uſed in Scripture as it is, in a differing ſort from the plural: of which dual number I have ſpoken more at large in my <hi>Treatiſe of Holy time,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the word <hi>Gaarbaijm (the twofold Evening)</hi> and there I have ſhewed that it doth not ſignifie a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed mixture of any two or more things together, as when light and darkneſs are confounded in the twilight, (as ſome do erroneouſly interpret it) but that it doth ſignifie two ſeveral things connexed together, without confounding their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This obſervation of the dual number doth make the ſaid ſenſitive life, and the rational life of thoſe that periſhed in the flood, to be two diſtinct ſpecies, and yet connexed in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence obſerve, that when God did firſt inſpire the abſolute or eſſential life of <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul into his body, it was to give the form to the matter: and 2. That when he did with the ſame Breath inſpire a concreated life after his own image and likeneſs, (in moral perfections) he did conjoyn it as a diſtinct ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to his ſaid eſſential life, as an accident to its ſubject, and therefore it was no true part of his eſſential life; neither did it flow from his nature eſſentially, as the faculties do from the ſoul: for then it could not have ceaſed to be without the deſtruction of the ſubject that did ſupport it. 3. Therefore it was but an appendix which the God of nature had conjoyned to his eſſential ſoul, even as he conjoyned an admirable beauty to <hi>Moſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. In caſe the Covenant of nature had been made in relation to the moral Law of nature, then doubtleſs the threatning would have been continued even againſt the humane nature of Chriſt. But ſaith Mr.
<hi>Rutherford</hi> on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. you cannot ſhew me in all the old Teſtament any poenal Law of active obebience, as poenal impoſed upon the man Chriſt: where is is written, <hi>If the man Chriſt ſin, he ſhall eternally dye:</hi> I tremble, ſaith he, at ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The like muſt be affirmed of <hi>Adam,</hi> for he was created after the image and likeneſs of God in moral perfections; ſo that he could not will to ſin againſt any branch of the moral Law of his nature, until he had firſt loſt the rectitude of his nature, by ſinning againſt the arbitrary Law of the Covenant of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by his tranſient act of eating of the forbidden fruit: then he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deprived of Gods concreated image of moral perfections, and then he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34410:29"/> could do nothing elſe but ſin againſt every branch of that moral Law; then the thoughts and imaginations of his heart were evil and only evil all the day long, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. But tis no leſs then horrible blaſphemy to affirm that the humane nature of Chriſt was obliged under the ſame Covenant of nature: I grant he was born under the moral Law of nature, as much as <hi>Adam</hi> was, but he was not put under the ſame Covenant of nature that <hi>Adam</hi> was, becauſe he was none of his natural generation, but was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, that ſo he might be put under the poſitive Law of Mediatorſhip, but yet without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any threatning.</p>

                  </gap>cquired by Creation. 2. That wherein he exerciſed his power acquired by redemption: and Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> doth give his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this aſſertion, as a moſt clear truth, in his anſwer to <hi>Crandon, pag.</hi> 26. God ſaith he hath three Kingdoms in <hi>ſpecie</hi> over mankind, whereof the firſt two are here on Earth, and the third in Heaven. The firſt, ſaith he, was the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God over perfect man, and is never called the Kingdom of the Son, or of the Mediator, or Redeemer: this endured but till the fall of man. The ſecond is the Kingdom of the Son, or of the Redeemer, which is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by the foundation right (general redemption) by its ends, laws, ſtate of the ſubjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The work and end of this Kingdom is to effect mans cure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. 3.

<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> Chriſt was promiſed, and by that promiſe the government of mankind was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and God did new model his Kingdom; for thereupon followed a new conſtitution, new laws, and new judgement did proceed afterwards in a new manner.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Saith he, by this promiſe the Covenant of works was made void, and that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34410:30"/> Law, as promiſing life only upon condition of perfect, perſonal, and perpetual obedience, without any promiſe of pardon of any the leaſt ſin, <hi>was repealed;</hi> and the poſitive Law of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil did ceaſe.</p>

               <p n="7">7. Though the Law of works, as a condition and only condition of life be repealed, yet the pure morals continue in force to bind man to obedience, or puniſhment in general, but not to obedience perfect as the condition of life, nor yet to puniſhment as no ways removeable. To argue, that becauſe the matter of the moral Laws continue in precepts and prohibitions, therefore the Law of works continues, is vain, for it may continue in another manner, and to another

                  </gap>nd, and both the end and manner far different.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Saith he, to ſay that man is under the Law of works, as <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt, until he be in Chriſt, is very falſe: It is true he is under the execution of that ſentence, which paſſed upon man for his ſin, againſt the Law both moral and poſitive given to
<hi>Adam:</hi> and he cannot paſs from death to life, from the ſtate of damnation to the ſtate of ſalvation, till he be in Chriſt by a true and lively faith; and when we are in Chriſt, we are not wholly freed from the ſentence, becauſe it continues partly in force until the reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 82. when the firſt government did determine, the ſecond did begin: for after the fall of two of Gods moſt noble creatures, there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great alteration in the world; and ſuch, that if God had followed ſtrictly the rules of his former government, all mankind muſt needs have periſhed: but Gods mercy could not ſuffer this; therefore his divine wiſdom continueth a way how to recover fallen man, and began to govern him according to ſuch rules, as he might attain eternal ſalvation.</p>

The ſubject of this latter; is not man holy, righteous, innocent, as he was created; but ſinful, guilty, and miſerable in <hi>Adam</hi> fallen. 3.

Whereas many tell us that the former government continues, that the Laws are ſtill the ſame, that God as Rector by ſubſtitution transfered the puniſhment merited by tranſgreſſion of the Law, upon Chriſt: and for and in conſideration of ſatisfaction made by him, remits ſin; and that this is nothing elſe but a relaxation, or interpretation of the former Law: they are much miſtaken, and reach not the truth in this particular.

Gods purpoſe was not to bring fallen man to life, by the ruines of any natural abilities: there was a barre put in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. that we ſhould not think of any hope in that.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 146. To think that the promiſes, threats, and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of works do continue under the Goſpel, or remain at any time in the Kingdom of God Redeemer, is an error, and a great miſtake.</p>
               <p>It is one thing to bind unto perfect obedience, another thing to bind unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, as the condition of life. This latter was eſſential to the moral Law, as given at firſt (to <hi>Adam)</hi> and in that reſpect it is truly and properly ſaid, that the Law of works is abrogated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibidem</hi> ſaith he, in this reſpect it is not proper, nay it is not true to ſay, that God in the moral Law binds man unto perfect and perpetual obedience; for ſo it doth not: he binds to perfect and perpetual obedience (which man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, nor can perform) or to puniſhment by his Saviour, and upon faith in him removeable, and not to obedience and puniſhment too.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 279. All the penalties on
<hi>Cain,</hi> the old World, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Babel,</hi> and the reſt were penalties as threatned by, ſo inflicted for ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God Redeemer: all this (ſaith he) is evident from the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, which ſpeak to men as ſinful, promiſe Chriſt, forbid impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, preach and urge repentance, and make all penalties removeable upon that condition, which could not have been done, if ſin and penalties had been look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon according to the Law of works.</p>
               <p>It is in vain therefore to argue that, becauſe as the Law of works command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love to God, love to our neighbor, did forbid idolatry, murther, theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did threaten death and puniſhment for theſe ſins<hi>:</hi> ſo the Goſpel commands the ſame duties, forbids the very ſame things, threatneth the ſame penalties, and promiſeth life, that therefore the Law of works continueth, eſpecially the moral Law; for the precepts, prohibitions, promiſes, and threats of the Law, and of the Law of grace come under different notions: as for inſtance.</p>
               <p>We may among many places ſingle out this one; <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Eſa. 55. 7. [but the Law of works doth not ſay ſo] but it ſaith, <hi>Be not wicked, ſin not at all:</hi> the Law of grace ſaith, <hi>Though thou haſt ſinned, and art wicked, yet forſake thy wicked way, and return unto the Lord, againſt whom thou baſt ſinned:</hi> the Law of works ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt ſinned, and muſt die; I have no promiſe of life or pardon for thee:</hi> but the Law of grace ſaith, <hi>Though thou haſt by thy ſia deſerved to die, yet upon condition of repentance and return thou ſhalt be pardoned, and live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I touch the more often upon this point (ſaith he) and here ſtand the more largely upon it, becauſe ſome will take no notice of it; others, who are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed, are hardly perſwaded of this difference, and of the abrogation of the Law of works, which to a guilty perſon denies all poſſibility of ſalvation.</p>

Saith he, no man ought to preach the Law of works unto ſinful man, as now in force; for that makes ſin unpardonable, and it is the high way to cauſe deſpair: he indeed that will only threaten death and puniſhment, according to the Law of works, and ſilence the promiſe of the Goſpel, is a legal Preacher indeed, and can be no faithful ſervant of Chriſt in this world.</p>

               <p>And as touching the utter nulling of the Covenant of nature, which he calls the government of Gods creatures, I do fully agree with him: but yet I differ from him in certain particulars, eſpecially in the matter of the condition of the Covenant of nature (which he doth call the Law of works, though very much amiſs, becauſe it is a miſleading title) he makes the matter of the Covenant of nature to relate to <hi>Adams</hi> obedience to the moral Law of his nature; but I make it to be only in relation to his obedience to the arbitrary Law and Covenant, by one ſingle act of eating only, as I have before explained my meaning.</p>

                  <p>From the premiſſes in this Section it followes, that the kind of death that God threatned in the Covenant of nature, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
17. was no other but a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spiritual death; as I have opened it before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the life promiſed (in oppoſition to this kind of death) was no other but the confirmation of his concreated life after Gods image in moral perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the ſweet contents of an earthly Paradiſe, and not a life in Heaven, as I have opened it more at large in the fourth Section.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the conditional matter of <hi>Adams</hi> obedience to the Covenant of nature, cannot be called the matter of a ſinners juſtification, becauſe Chriſt never performed that condition by eating of the Tree of life, neither was he at any time under that Covenant to perform it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is alſo a truth which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did at the firſt deny; namely, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Covenant is totally repealed, we need not care for the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Covenant, in reſpect of any of our perſonal actions, but only in reſpect of

1. ſaith, the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. doth make the condition of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> (before his fall) to be animal and earthly; and that of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> to be ſpiritual and heavenly: (and to this ſence doth <hi>P. Martyr</hi> expound this verſe, cited before at
<hi>Reply</hi> 10.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 2. The flower and choiceſt of <hi>Adams</hi> Paradiſe eſtate is an earthly condition; as it is evident, 1. By his eating, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 9, 16. 2. By his ſleeping,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 21. 3. By his being placed in a Garden to dreſs it,

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 5. <hi>Adam</hi> was predeſtinated to life through Jeſus Chriſt; but yet not as a publick perſon repreſenting all his ſons; but as a ſingle perſon, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob, &amp;c.</hi> therefore we are predeſtinated to life eternal, <hi>Not in him, but in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 29, 30.</p>
               <p>(And from hence I do alſo infer, that none are predeſtinated or juſtified from ſin, or adopted to the heavenly Paradiſe, for their performance of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt Covenant of nature, namely, not for their eating of the Tree of life in <hi>Adam</hi> their publick head, neither could Chriſt become our ſurety to fulfil the condition of that Covenant for us, becauſe he was none of <hi>Adams</hi> natural generation, with whom only that Covenant was made.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> doth propound this Query, in
<hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 49. What life was it that was promiſed in the Covenant of works? his anſwer is; not a life in Chriſt, and the fruit of the merit of blood, as our life is in the new Covenant, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. But tis a Law life (happily a communion in glory) But (ſaith he) the life he lived; and the creatures for his ſervice ſeems not to belong to the life of glory: and ſaith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 14. The conditional decree of
<hi>Adams</hi> life, if he ſhould do the Law (of nature) was not predeſtination to eternal glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 20. Tis not written in the heart of man by nature, that God ſhould promiſe eternal life to man, upon condition of obedience: for it were nothing againſt juſtice or bounty, or any attribute of God, not to reward his creature which is obliged to ſerve him: nor can the promiſe as touching ſuch a Covenant be written in his heart, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. And unto this I adde (that by the like reaſon) neither can the threatning of death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. be written in
<hi>Adams</hi> heart for his eating of the forbidden Tree.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>George Walker</hi> in his <hi>Doctrine of the Sabbath, pag.</hi> 16. ſaith, The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of life being ſealed, by
<hi>Adams</hi> eating of that Tree (which was the ſeal of the Covenant, as it appears by Gods ſpeech in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22.) man had been confirmed in that natural life and eſtate wherein God had created him, and the Devil could have had no power, either to ſeduce him, or to prevail by his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 28. I confeſs and believe, that man by his perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence performed to God in his own perſon, according to the firſt Covenant of works, might have continued in that earthly life, and natural happineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was created: but that he had any ſupernatural or ſpiritual power given him before the promiſe of Chriſt, whereby he was fitted for heavenly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or that any ſuch happineſs was promiſed him in the firſt Covenant, or any grace (of juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> tending thereunto, I cannot be perſwaded; and then he gives divers reaſons for the confirming of his ſaid aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 34. If the obſervation of the weekly Sabbath were but a dictate of nature written in mans heart in the Creation, then were the chief end and aim of it no more but an earthly felicity, and the fruition of a natural life in an earthly Paradiſe: and to this ſence he doth alſo reaſon in <hi>pag.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 39. Though God did create man perfect after his own image, yet I do not read that this image did comprehend any more in it, but natural gifts and endowments only: and he ſpeaketh much more to this effect in <hi>pag.</hi> 32, 33, 37.</p>

               <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Method, pag.</hi> 342. That <hi>Adams</hi> obedience to keep the Law, was not of grace, but <hi>ut naturae debita,</hi> as due to his nature out of the common goodneſs, which furniſhed every Creature in its kinde, with thoſe principles and abilities which were neceſſary to them for the attaining of the reſpective ends to which they were created: but (ſaith he) to quicken us when we are dead, and to reſtore loſt abilities; yea, to vegitate and maintain them againſt contrary principles, either of inclinations from within, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions from without, is ſuch ſpecial grace as
<hi>Adam</hi> in that eſtate received not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 36. If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued righteous, he might well have propagated life to his children, but not ſalvation, becauſe they had never been in danger of death. This aſſertion doth by neceſſary conſequence prove that <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency ſhould not have had any other life, then a perfect natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life for ever in Paradiſe only.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Book called, <hi>The manifold wiſdom of God,</hi> (which ſome ſay was Mr. <hi>George Walkers.)</hi> doth often call the Covenant made with <hi>Adam, The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of nature,</hi> as in <hi>pag.</hi>
50, 93, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſaid Author ſaith in <hi>pag.</hi> 51. That the ſign and ſeal which God gave to man for the confirmation of this Covenant, was the Tree of life, which was to man a Sacrament: (and ſo <hi>Bernard</hi> doth alſo call it a Sacramental Tree) and a pledge of eternal life on Earth, and of all bleſſings needful to keep man in life: and the receiving of this ſeal was the eating of the Tree of life: and the end of this Covenant was the upholding of the Creation, and all Creatures in their perpetual natural eſtate, for the benefit of man continually: this was the firſt Covenant that God made with man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 89. The Seal of the firſt Covenant was the Tree of life, which if <hi>Adam</hi> had received by eating thereof in the ſtate of innocency, before
<note place="margin">Adam <hi>in his innocency might not kill and eat the fleſh of any Creatures: but being fallen he hath now liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through Chriſts ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to kill for typical ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to kill and to eat fleſh at other times alſo.</hi>
                  </note> his fall, he had certainly been eſtabliſhed in that eſtate for ever, and could not have been ſeduced and ſupplanted by Satan, (as ſome learned men do think) and as Gods own words do ſeem to imply, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 93. The promiſes of God in the Covenant of nature, were only natural life and earthly happineſs, with all bleſſings neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

                  </gap> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to eat and refreſh ones ſelf with meat: and ſaith he, there is ſome reaſons thereof, becauſe the old Covenant of God made with man in the Creation, was a Covenant wherein the Condition or Law was about eating: and ſo alſo in the ſolemn making and ſealing of the Covenant of grace in Chriſt the bleſſed ſeed; the publick ceremony was the ſlaying and ſacrificing of beaſts, and eating ſome part of them, after the fat and choice pieces were offered and burnt on the Altar: for by vertue of that Covenant God gave man leave to eat the fleſh of beaſts, which he might not do in the ſtate of innocency,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 29, and ſo alſo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34410:33"/> in the ſolemn Covenants that were made betwixt men, the parties were wont to eat together, as it appears by
<hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 30. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 31 54. And to this ſence doth Mr.
<hi>Walker</hi> ſpeak in his <hi>Doctrine of the Sabbath, pag.</hi> 29. namely, that <hi>Adam</hi> had power given him in the ſtate of innocency, to rule over all Cattel and all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, only to order them and command them for his delight and pleaſure: but (ſaith he) in Chriſt he had power given him to kill, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and to eat them, and to uſe them for his profit.</p>

               <p>Concluſion from the premiſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence it followes, that ſundry Chriſtian writers and <hi>Ebrew</hi> Doctors do agree, that the kinde of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fe that was promiſed in the Covenant of nature, was no other but the confirmation of <hi>Adams</hi> concreated life, after the image of God in moral perfections; which concreated life he inſpired as an adjunct to the eſſential life of his immortal ſoul, for his ſinleſs converſation in the ſweet contents of an earthly Paradiſe for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence alſo it followes by neceſſary conſequence, that the death that was threatned in oppoſition thereto, can be no other but a double kinde of Spiritual death to be continued in this world only, without any bodily death, for any thing that was revealed to the contrary in the Covenant of nature. God reſerved the puniſhment of a bodily death in his own ſecret minde for a time; namely, until he had firſt declared the new Covenant of grace and reconciliation, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15, but then he did preſently after threaten a bodily death; namely, in <hi>v.</hi> 19. not for <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit, but as a new puniſhment for his after ſinning quality; namely, for his Original ſin againſt every branch of the moral Law of nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the premiſes it followes, that Mr.
<hi>Norton</hi> is much miſtaken, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ming that the Covenant of grace and reconciliation hath its dependance on the Covenant of nature: 1. In relation to Chriſts ſatisfaction, and 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a ſinners juſtification. Seeing I have proved that the Covenant of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was totally extinguiſhed, before ever the Covenant of reconciliation was declared; and conſequently that it cannot have any likeneſs or agreement to the Covenant of nature, neither in the Author of it, nor in the ſubjects, nor in the conditions to be performed on mans part, nor yet in the promiſe or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor yet in the continuance of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Author of them is not the ſame: for the Author of the Covenant of nature is God the Creators of all natural beings: but the Author of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34410:35"/> of grace and reconciliation is God Redeemers in a ſupernatural way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no likeneſs or agreement between the ſubjects of theſe two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: for the ſubjects of the Covenant of nature was perfect natural mankind; but the ſubjects of the Covenant of reconciliation is man fallen and corrupted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is no likeneſs or agreement in the conditions that are to be performed on mans part: for the condition that God required to be performed on mans part in the Covenant of nature, was no more but one natural act of eating of the Tree of life in the firſt place, for the confirmation of his moral or natural perfections. But the condition that God hath required to be performed on mans part in the Covenant of reconciliation, is the ſupernatural act of faith in Chriſt, not to be once done only, but to be daily renewed. 4. There is no likeneſs or agreement in their promiſes and threatnings; for the promiſe of the Covenant of nature did reach no further, but to the confirmation of his concreated natural life for ever, in the ſweet contents of an earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> did firſt eat of the Tree of the twofold life<hi>:</hi> and the threatning of that Covenant was no other but a double Spiritual death to be ſuffered in this world only, in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> did but firſt eat of the forbidden fruit: but the promiſe of the Covenant of reconciliation doth reach far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this natural life; namely, to a ſupernatural and heavenly life for ever, in the ſweet contents of the heavenly Paradiſe to all ſuch as ſhall attain to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural grace of faith in Chriſt: and the threatning is an eternal death in Hell to all ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

There is no likeneſs or agreement in the continuance of theſe Covenants: for the Covenant of nature was ordained to laſt no longer in uſe, but until <hi>Adams</hi> obedience was tried by one ſingle act of eating; the which trial was alſo to be made in the very day of his Creation (as I have ſhewed it more at large elſewhere) as ſoon therefore as <hi>Adam</hi> had but taſted of the forbidden fruit in the firſt place, that Covenant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. was totally extinguiſhed, before ever the Covenant of reconciliation was declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and thence it followes by neceſſary conſequence, that the Covenant of reconciliation cannot have any dependance at all on the Covenant of nature, neither in relation to Chriſts ſatisfaction, nor yet in relation to a ſinners juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, nor yet in any other reſpect whatſoever, as Mr.
<hi>Nortons</hi> foundation propoſition doth affirm: but on the contrary God hath eſtabliſhed the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of reconciliation to be perpetuated to all

               <p n="4">4. Hence it doth alſo follow, that when God did firſt appoint a bodily death in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. he did at the ſame time appoint a particular judgement to follow it to each departed ſoul, as the Apoſtle doth tell us and aſſure us

Theſe three diſtinct ſorts of death have not any natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on each other; but they all proceed from the ſeveral threatnings of Gods juſtice; firſt from the threatning of the Covenant of nature, and the two other ſorts from the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore it is a great error to make theſe three diſtinct ſorts of death to be al threatned in the Covenant of nature, ſeeing the firſt ſort only was threatned in that Covenant, and the other two were only threatned under the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>But woe and alas! all theſe three ſeveral ſorts of death are confounded by Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> unlimited expoſition of the word

            <p>NO other death was threatned in the Covenant of nature, then ſuch as was

               </gap>e a bodily death was not then threatned.</p>
            <p>In my former Chapter I have given ſeveral demonſtrative reaſons, to prove that the death threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. was a concluding or a definitive threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and thence it followes, that that kinde of death (whatſoever it was) was moſt ſtrictly and formally executed in the very ſame day or point of time, in the which <hi>Adam</hi> did but taſte the forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The aſſumption is as clear as the Sun at noon-day, by
<hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 5. namely, that a bodily death was not then ſtrictly executed, becauſe it is there ſaid that <hi>Adam</hi> lived in body 930 years after that day.</p>
            <p>Thus both parts of the Argument ſtand firm and ſound.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have alſo ſhewed in the former Chapter, that a bodily death was not threatned, until after the Covenant of grace and reconciliation was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. But then preſently after <hi>Adams</hi> fall, (who fell in the day of his creation) a bodily death was threatned in <hi>v.</hi> 19. as a new and general pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

<hi>and then it was firſt threatned in</hi> v. 19.</note> to him, and to all his natural poſterity, for <hi>Adams</hi> new kinde of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nature: for I have ſhewed in the former Chapter, that the kind of death that was threatned, in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> did but taſte of the forbidden fruit, in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. was a double kind of Spiritual death; 1. By depriving
<hi>Adam</hi> of his concreated life of moral perfections after Gods image: and this deprivation was the act of Gods juſtice; and this deprivation is properly called death: and thence it followes, that in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> could have made a ſtop here from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinning againſt the moral Law of his concreated nature, he ſhould have had no further puniſhment<hi>:</hi> but 2. Becauſe of his ſaid deprivation, he could not make a ſtop here, but did inſtantly ſin againſt every branch of that Law of his moral perfection; and this new ſinning quality is now commonly called <hi>[Death in ſin]</hi> and tis alſo commonly called Original ſin; and it is alſo called by <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17, 20.
<hi>In-dwelling ſin:</hi> and it is in relation to this ſecond part of death in ſin, that God (after he had firſt declared the Covenant of grace to our fallen Parents, for their effectual converſion, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
15.) did ordain a bodily death in <hi>v.</hi> 19. as a general puniſhment to all the fallen Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and two other general puniſhments, 1. Sore travail to women in child-birth, and 2. Sore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to men for the ſupport of their bodily life: and this Covenant of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and theſe three general puniſhments are orderly ſet down in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.

               <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith in his eleventh Book on

            <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Weames</hi> doth confirm the ſame at large in his <hi>Portraiture, pag.</hi> 200.</p>
            <p>And thence it followes, that the kinde of death that was threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. was no other but a conditional Spiritual death only
<hi>(If thou eateſt of the forbidden fruit)</hi> and 2. Seeing it was in
<hi>Adams</hi> power not to eat of it, it doth from thence follow, that it did not work the leaſt fear in his innocent nature, as a bodily death did, becauſe a bodily death was abſolutely threatned, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his Spiritual death in ſin, or for his Original ſin: and thence it bred a terrible fear in his corrupted nature, and made him ſubject to that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of a natural fear all his life long, becauſe it was not in his power to eſcape it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I have given two other pregnant Arguments, to prove that neither a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death, nor yet an eternal death in Hell, were threatned in the Covenant of nature, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. at <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. to which place I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The diſtinction that I have made between the Covenant of nature (in the time of <hi>Adams</hi> innocency) and the Covenant of reconciliation, (after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fall) and 2. The diſtinction which I have made between the ſeveral threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the ſeveral kinds of death, in the ſaid two ſeveral and diſtinct Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, is the more narrowly to be marked, becauſe of the weightineſs of thoſe diſtinct differences, and alſo becauſe ſeveral ancient writers have given ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable hints of the ſaid diſtinctions, though they have not done it ſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the weight of the matter doth require.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I have cited three ancient writers, in <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.
<hi>Sect.</hi> 2. that do expound the kind of death that is threatned in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. of a Spiritual death only, and not of a bodily death: and their reaſon why they deny a bodily death to be there threatned, is, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did not die that day a bodily death, as he did a Spiritual death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth ſometimes expound the word <hi>Death,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. of three ſorts of death; namely,
1. Of the death of the ſoul in ſin, 2. Of the death of the body for ſin, and 3. Of an eternal death in Hell: yet he doth ſometimes diſtinguiſh them to the ſeveral threatnings of the two ſeveral Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: 1. He doth make the time of the threatning of a Spiritual death in ſin,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In the</hi> City of God, l. 13. c.
19.</note> to have relation only to <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. 2. He doth make the time of the threatning of a bodily death to have relation to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
19. his words run thus: In that the ſoul felt a diſobedient motion in the fleſh, and thereupon covered the bodies ſecret parts; in this was the firſt death felt, that is, the departure of the ſoul from God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Saith he, when the ſoul forſaketh the body; decayed with age, then is that other death felt, whereof God ſaid <hi>[In impoſing mans future paniſhment] Earth thou art, and to earth thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen. 3. 19.</p>
            <p>Theſe words of <hi>Auſtins</hi> have theſe two remarkable points; 1. That he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34410:40"/> the word <hi>Death,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
17. of that kinde of death, wherein the ſoul departed from God, when he did firſt eat of the forbidden fruit; which act was his tranſgreſſion of the Covenant of nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that he aſſignes bodily death to <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.

That though it was Gods time and ſeaſon to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> with the depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his concreated life of moral perfections, becauſe he, according to his abſolute arbitrary will, had threatned the firſt breach of that Covenant with a preſent Spiritual death, in the very firſt point of time when he did but taſte of the forbidden fruit: yet it was not his will to declare the time and ſeaſon when he would inflict a bodily death, for his new kinde of Original ſinning; but on the contrary it was his good will and pleaſure to reſerve the puniſhment thereof in his ſecret minde, until he had firſt declared his new Covenant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. but then it was his good pleaſure to threaten a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death in <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When <hi>Adam</hi> was under the puniſhment of a Spiritual death; 1. By be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>It was not written in the heart of</hi> Adam, <hi>that God would puniſh his new ſinning quality, either with a bodily, or with an eternal death in Hell.</hi>
                  </note> deprived of his concreated life of moral perfection, (which was beſtowed on him for the moral rectitude of his nature) he could not keep himſelf from further ſinning againſt every branch of the moral Law; and then his guilty conſcience told him, that he deſerved further puniſhment, as it is evident by his anſwer to the Lords firſt <hi>Quere,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>I heard thy voice in the Garden, and I was afraid; and becauſe I was naked</hi> (of thy concreated life) <hi>I bid my ſelf, becauſe my guilty conſcience told me that I deſerved a further puniſhment for my new kind of ſinning nature, beſides my preſent puniſhment of a Spiritual death:</hi> but what kind of further puniſhment it ſhould be, he could not tell, becauſe God had not yet declared it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> on the Covenant faith, in

               <p n="7">7. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Aphoriſ. pag.</hi> 13. There are ſome general obſcure threatnings annexed to the prohibitions of the Law of nature, that is (ſaith he) nature may diſcern that God will puniſh the breakers of his Law, but how or with what degree of puniſhment, it cannot diſcern.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> on the Covenant ſaith, in
<hi>pag.</hi> 21. It is not a good infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſay, that becauſe there is diſquietneſs in the conſcience after ſin, and becauſe it is natural to a ſinner to apprehend a revenging power purſuing ſin committed, that therefore it is natural and eſſential to God to purſue ſin with puniſhment in general: and from hence I infer, that it was not written in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> by nature, that God would puniſh his firſt new begun ſinning quality with a bodily death; but it was the ſecret will of God to defer his threatning of that death, until he had firſt publiſhed his new Covenant of grace in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and then it was in his free choice alſo to have puniſhed it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It was the good pleaſure of God, after the Covenant of nature was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion of it, and after the new Covenant of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation was declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. to conſtitute three ſeveral ſorts of general puniſhments to all
<hi>Adams</hi> natural poſterity for their Original ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaid thus to the woman, in <hi>v.</hi> 16. and conſequently to all her ſex, <hi>I</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God ordained three general puniſhments in the Covenant of grace for Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>will greatly multiply thy ſorrow, and thy conception; in ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth children, and thy deſire ſhall be to thy husband, and he ſhall rule over thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it may be demanded why the woman is firſt threatned.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle doth anſwer, becauſe ſhe was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Her puniſhment (ſaith <hi>Ainſ.)</hi> was to be to her and to all her ſex as a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement. Here (ſaith he) are annexed not curſes, but chaſtiſements, for <hi>Eve</hi> and
<hi>Adam,</hi> that their faith in the promiſed ſeed might be continually ſtirred up, and their ſinful nature ſubdued and mortified, <hi>Ebr.</hi>
12. 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 71. and a little after he ſaith, <hi>The reaſon of this chaſtiſement is, becauſe ſin is from Adam derived by propagation to all his poſterity,</hi> Pſal. 51. 7. Rom. 5. 12.
<hi>Howbeit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this chaſtiſement bindreth not a womans ſalvation with God; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they ſhall be ſaved in child-bearing, if they continue in ſaith, and love, and holineſs, with ſobriety,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 15.</p>
               <p>I do from hence intreat the Reader to take ſpecial notice, that <hi>Ainſ.</hi> doth not make the threatning of this puniſhment to women-kind, to belong to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of nature, but of grace; and that God delivers this threatning to <hi>Eve,</hi> (in the hearing of <hi>Adam)</hi> as they were now converted to the faith by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Covenant of grace and reconciliation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is further evident, that the ſaid threatning to women-kind doth belong only to the Covenant of grace, becauſe God ordained ſacrifices of atonement for child-bearing women; namely, 1. Typically for the expiation of their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſins of uncleanneſs by child-birth,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 12. 2, 3, 4. and 2. Typifying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the expiation of all their Original ſins againſt the moral Law, by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34410:44"/> of Chriſt to all ſuch ſinners as do believe in Gods atonement through his meritorious ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was yet another kind of puniſhment laid upon women-kind; namely, that their deſires muſt be to their husbands; that is to ſay, in ſubjection, (as the Original word doth ſignifie, in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7.) implying, that now they were put into a greater ſubjection to their husbands, then they ſhould have been, if <hi>Eve</hi> had not been firſt in the tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of general puniſhment for Original ſin,</p>
               <p>Was that the ground, which at firſt was created for
<hi>Adams</hi> ſolace in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, without any hurtful thing in it, ſhould now be curſed with barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and made ſubject to vanity, 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. waiting with earneſt expectation when the ſons of God ſhould be delivered from their Original ſin, that it alſo might then be delivered from its bondage of corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mark how God doth ſet forth the reaſon of this puniſhment to fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt hearkned unto the voice of thy wiſe, and haſt eaten of the Tree, of which I commanded thee, ſaying, Thou ſhalt not eat of it; curſed be the ground for thy ſake; in ſorrow ſhalt thou cut of it all the days of thy life. Thorns alſo and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth unto thee, and thou ſhalt eat of the herbs of the field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reaſon is expreſſed in the conjunction of two things;
1. <hi>In that thou haſt hearkned unto the voice of thy wife,</hi> and 2.
<hi>Haſt eaten of the Tree:</hi> Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had but only hearkned to the voice of his wife with a deaf ear, and had not obeyed it by his actual eating, he had not tranſgreſſed the Covenant of nature, neither had <hi>Eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> tranſgreſſed it, when ſhe perceived that the Tree was good for meat, and a deſire to her eyes, in caſe ſhe had gone no further, but to give a hearing only to the voice of the Serpent, and had not eaten; for nothing elſe was expreſly forbidden, but the act of eating only. Our Saviour heard the Devils voice in perſwading him to caſt himſelf down from the pinacle of the Temple, and at another time to fall down and worſhip him; but becauſe he only heard his voice, and refuſed to obey the Devils perſwaſions, he was not defiled with his temptations. In like ſort if
<hi>Adam</hi> had only hearkned to her voice, and had not obeyed, but had refuſed to eat thereof, he had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And 2. In caſe he had eſpied the danger of her temptation, and ſo had refuſed to eat of it, then doubtleſs he would ſtreightway have made choice to eat of the Tree of life in the firſt place, becauſe it was both commanded to be eaten, and alſo commended unto him by its [name <hi>life]</hi> and then his concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life of moral perfections had been confirmed unto him for ever, and to all his natural poſterity ſucceſſively, notwithſtanding that <hi>Eve</hi> had firſt eaten of it, and then the Covenant of nature ſhould nor have been broken by her act of eating, (until <hi>Adam</hi> did eat of it) becauſe nor ſhe, but <hi>Adam</hi> was ordained to be the head in that Covenant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This repeating of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion of the Covenant of nature, with the temptation or occaſion of it, now after he was re-created and converted, by the declaration of the ſaid new Covenant of reconciliation) was to make him and all his fallen poſterity take the greater notice of their corrupt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eſtate, as the only procuring cauſe of ſeveral great curſes upon all the face of the Earth, ſo that now all hope of a bleſſed and happy life here on Earth,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34410:44"/> promiſed at firſt in the Covenant of nature, is utterly cut off: as if God had ſaid thus unto <hi>Adam;</hi> my definitive threatning of a Spiritual death, in caſe thou didſt firſt eat of the prohibited Tree, hath brought thee under a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<note place="margin">Such as look for a perfect ſinleſs life under the fifth Monarchy, may look their eyes out before they ſhall ſee it.</note> of ſinning by Original ſin: and for that new habit of thy ſinning nature I have curſed the Earth for thy ſake all the days of thy life (and conſequently all the days of the life of thy natural poſterity) to put thee and them out of all hope of ever being reſtored again to thy firſt concreated life of moral perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and from thence ſuch as dream of a ſinleſs life here, under the fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, may ſee from this definitive ſentence, that their hope is but a meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and that all the Scriptures they bring for it are but miſinterpreted, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no revocation of that definitive puniſhment of a Spiritual death in ſin in this world, until the reſurrection of the body, when it ſhall be changed into a ſpiritual nature, like unto the glorious body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third ſort of general puniſhment for Original ſin, which is alſo called, <hi>Inhabiting ſin,</hi> Rom. 7. 17, 20. is a bodily death, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, until thou return unto the ground; for out of it was thou taken: for duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle doth aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re us in <hi>Ebr.</hi> 9. 27. that when God ordained a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death for all the fallen poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> he did at the ſame time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a particular judgement to follow to each departed ſoul; namely, to all ſuch as died in the faith of their redemption by the promiſed ſeed of the woman, an eternal life in Heaven, but to all the reſt that died in the unbelief thereof, an eternal death in Hell.</p>
               <p>But no ſuch promiſe of an eternal life in Heaven was made in the Covenant of nature, neither was there any threatning made of an eternal death in Hell. 2. This general puniſhment of Original ſin by a bodily death, is by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of reconciliation turned to be a bleſſing to ſuch as ſhall die in the faith of their redemption by the promiſed ſeed of the woman: for when they come to die, the puniſhment of their Spiritual death in ſin ſhall ceaſe to their ſouls, though not altogether to their bodies till the reſurrection, and then they ſhall enjoy an everlaſting heavenly Paradiſe, inſtead of the earthly which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt by his ſin.</p>
               <p>And 3. By the new Covenant of grace and reconciliation all the elect have an abſolute promiſe of regeneration, to ſuppreſs the tyranny of their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corruptions, but yet not to ſubdue it wholly, until another Spiritual rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration be added to the body at the reſurrection.

12. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 15.) it is to be obſerved that it is not cleanſed, but only by breaking it: and (ſaith he) this breaking of earthen veſſels to cleanſe them from uncleanneſs, ſignified the aboliſhing of Original ſin by death: we are compared, ſaith he, to earthen veſſels, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. and the breaking of ſuch is death,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 38.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant of nature promiſed no other life but a ſinleſs life in the ſweet contents of an earthly Paradiſe; but the Covenant of reconciliation doth promiſe an eternal life in Heaven, in

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34410:45"/> a bodily death, which through Gods ſanctiſying grace ſhould become as an introduction to this eternal life in Heaven to all the elect: and ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it threatned a bodily death, as an introduction to an eternal death in Hell to all that die in the unbelief of their redemption by the promiſed ſeed of the woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fleſh and blood,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth corruption inherit incorruption,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Hence it followes that a bodily death was not threatned, until after the new Covenant of reconciliation was firſt declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and then it was threatned in <hi>v.</hi> 19. for the puniſhment of Original ſin: and to this ſence have the ancient
<hi>Ebrew</hi> Doctors ſpoken; unto this world, ſay they, there cleaveth the ſecret filthineſs of the Serpent which came upon <hi>Eve: And becauſe of that filthineſs death is come upon Adam and his ſeed,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>But when that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs is conſumed, and the ſpirit of uncleanneſs taken out of the Earth, Behold God will renew this world without any other filthineſs, and will make up by his power thoſe that dwell in the duſt.</hi> This is cited by <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence theſe twothings, 1.

               <hi>Shewing that an eternal death in Hell was not threatned in the Covenant of nature, in</hi> Gen. 2. 17.</p>
            <p>IN my former Chapter I have given ſeveral conſiderable reaſons, why a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death was not threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. and from thence I reaſon thus:</p>
            <p>If a bodily death was not threatned in <hi>Gen,</hi> 2. 17. then an eternal death in Hell was not there threatned: for none are condemned to an eternal death in
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1.</note> Hell, until their bodily death do go before: and I hope that none will be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, as to affirm that God did threaten <hi>Adam</hi> with a death of going quick to Hell, (as <hi>Corah</hi> and his unbelieving Company did) without the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of a bodily death, as ſoon as he had taſted of the forbidden fruit, for then he could not have begotten a natural generation to fill the Earth, and then this great Univerſe ſhould have ſerved for no other uſe, but for the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:34410:45"/> But in my former Chapter I have made it evident,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a bodily death was not threatned in the Covenant of nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it was not threatned until after the Covenant of grace was firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. but then it was threatned in <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That when God did firſt threaten a bodily death, he did at the ſame time appoint a particular judgement to follow to each departed ſoul, as the Apoſtle doth tell us in <hi>Ebr.</hi> 9. 27. namely, to ſuch as died in the faith of their redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the promiſed ſeed of the woman, a judgement to an eternal life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but to all the reſt that died in the unbelief thereof, a judgement to an eternal death in Hell.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That when God appointed a particular judgement to each departed ſoul, he did at the ſame time alſo appoint a day of general judgement for all dead bodies at the end of this world, that ſo the dead bodies of all believers might be re-united to their glorified ſouls, and alſo that the dead bodies of all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers might be re-united to their condemned ſouls to the everlaſting torments of Hell.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thence it followes, 1. Negatively, that no eternal death was threatned in the Covenant of nature, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. 2. Affirmatively, that an eternal death in Hell was threatned only in the Covenant of grace, and to none elſe but to ſuch ſinners as are unbelievers only (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19.)</p>
            <p n="6">6. Though no diſtinction is made between the elect and reprobates, in that Spiritual death that is threatned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. (as Mr. <hi>Norto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> would have it) yet there is a wide difference made between them in the death threatned in the Covenant of grace, as in <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that will believe ſhall be ſaved, and he that will not believe ſhall be damned:</hi> and to this ſence doth <hi>John</hi> ſpeak, <hi>John</hi> 3.
16, 17, 18, 19, 36. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. And our Saviour doth tell us, that the ſin of unbelief is the great condemning ſin of the world,
<hi>John</hi> 16. 9. all other ſins are no otherwiſe damnable, but as they are companions of this ſin of unbelief, which indeed is the only ſin that doth finally break the conditions of the Covenant of grace.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is acknowledged by ſundry eminent writers, which I have cited in <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. that in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> had formed the condition required of him in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of nature, by his obedient act of eating firſt of the Tree of life, yet he ſhould have had no other life by that Covenant, but a perfect natural life in the ſweet contents of an earthly Paradiſe: and thence it followes by the rule of contraries, that God did not in that Covenant threaten any other death, but a Spiritual death only, 1. By deprivation, and 2. By corruption of nature that followed thereupon, to be inflicted eternally in this world only, as the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per puniſhment of his diſobedient act of eating the forbidden fruit: for no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death was as yet revealed, but it was reſerved in the ſecret mind of God, until he had declared his new Covenant. <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi> ſaith this laſt part of our Spiritual death; namely, corruption of nature, doth proceed from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of deprivation; for (ſaith he) holineſs and righteouſneſs being loſt, and the ſoul being inſtructed by the will, which cannot be idle, muſt needs turn to the contrary part: and (ſaith he) the loſs of ſupernatural gifts (for ſo he doth (though amiſs) call
<hi>Adams</hi> concreated life of moral perfections) doth occaſion corruption to thoſe which are (eſſentially) natural, as blindneſs to the mind,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34410:46"/> perverſeneſs to the will, and perturbation to the appetites. And ſaith <hi>P. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> in <hi>Com. pl. par.</hi> 2.
<hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. Though the powers of the mind and the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do remain, yet being (by deptivation) made deſtitute of their right govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are therefore evil and corrupted.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is acknowledged generally, that an eternal death in Hell is threatned to all unbelievers only; and thence it followes, that it was not threatned in the Covenant of nature, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. becauſe Chriſt was not revealed to be the Mediator of that Covenant, but of the after Covenant of grace only. This is a ſtrong and pregnant argument againſt Mr.
<hi>Nortons</hi> three ſorts of death to be threatned in the Covenant of nature, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>

<hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity are deprived of the concreated life of his moral perfections for his firſt ſin: and 2.

               <hi>Being a further diſcuſſion of the Covenant of nature made with</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>and proving that</hi> Adams <hi>natural underſtanding and will was made in perfect obedience to the moral Law of nature by Creation only, and not by any ſuper-added Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. MR. <hi>Clendon</hi> ſaith, (in his Sermon of Juſtification, <hi>pag.</hi> 22, 23.) that <hi>Adam</hi> was under the obedience of the moral Law, before God made any Covenant with him,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. God created man in his own image, and this image of God did ſtand in perfect knowledge, righteouſneſs, and holineſs, ſo that at the very firſt inſtant of his Creation, he was under the obedience of the moral Law, before ever God brought him into Paradiſe: but (ſaith he) the Covenant was not made with him, until after he came into Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. (Saith he) It may well be called the Law of nature, but not the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of nature, becauſe no promiſe of any reward was made unto
<hi>Adam</hi> for the keeping of the moral Law; therefore perfect obedience unto the moral Law was not the condition of the firſt Covenant, but it was a neceſſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans perfection, and a neceſſary conſequent of Gods perfection that man was ſo made: and Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> ſpeaks to this ſence at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 9.</p>

               </gap>on, or of his actual obedience in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law: and (ſaith he) in his next Chapter, I deny the aſſumption; God did not give the Law of the Decalogue, to be the only and perpetual rule of that juſtice, which is the way whereby <hi>de facto,</hi> he brings to eternal life all that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth affirm the contrary all along; namely, that <hi>Adams</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and natural obedience was ordained to be the matter of juſtification in the Covenant of works, (namely, in the Covenant of nature) for the attaining of an eternal life in Heaven, to be performed by our ſelves, or by our ſurety: but his Scriptures that he hath cited to prove it, are all wreſted from their true ſence as I have ſhewed in
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. and elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> on the <hi>Covenant, pag.</hi> 19 ſaith, Man as a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture owes himſelf to God, to obey ſo far as the Law written in his heart car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him: but ſaith he, there is not any promiſe of life, as a reward of the work of obedience here. 2. Saith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 20. It is not written in the heart of man by nature, that God ſhould promiſe eternal life upon condition of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, either in the general, or ſo and ſo. 3. Saith he, the Lord doth plead his free Covenant for his ſtanding rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 13, 15. This he ſpeaks of the very time of <hi>Adams</hi> innocency: but yet I grant alſo that he doth afterwards affirm, that God made it juſt to reward <hi>Adams</hi> moral obedience with life: but yet take ſpecial notice alſo, that he doth not affirm it to be meant of a life in Heaven, (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth) for in
<hi>pag.</hi> 49. he doth propound this queſtion: What is meaned by the life promiſed in the Covenant of works? he anſwers
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34410:49"/> thus; 1. Not a life in Chriſt, and the fruit of the merit of blood, as our life is in the new Covenant, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. but tis a Law life, happily a communion in glory: but (yet ſaith he) the life he lived, and the Creatures for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſeemes not to belong to that life: and 2. Take ſpecial notice, that Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford</hi> doth deny the obedience of Chriſt to the moral Law of nature, to be the matter of a believing ſinners juſtification, as I have ſhewed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. and <hi>Reply</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Grayl</hi> ſaith (on the Covenant of grace,

            <p n="6">6. In caſe we could perform obedience to the moral Law, as exactly as <hi>Adam</hi> did in his innocency; yet it could not be accepted of God for the matter of our juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Luther</hi> doth not make our juſtification to lie in our conformity to the moral Law of nature, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth; but he doth place it in Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, for the ſake of Chriſt received by faith, in ſeveral places on the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and in his Argument to

            <p>From hence it is evident, that <hi>Luther</hi> held no righteouſneſs to ſinners in Gods fight, by the moral obedience of Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth: but he placeth it in Gods forgiveneſs, for the ſake of Chriſts obedience in his death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or applied to the ſoul by faith.</p>

               <p>From hence I reaſon thus: If theſe evil effects had been firſt executed on <hi>Eves</hi> ſingle perſon, for her firſt act of eating the forbidden fruit, before <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten, (as doubtleſs they would, in caſe her act of eating had been a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any branch of the moral Law of nature) then <hi>Adam,</hi> ſoul which was made naturally holy and righteous, could not otherwiſe chooſe but have taken ſpecial notice of it, and then he would certainly have ſhunned to have eaten of the forbidden fruit from her hand, that ſo he might not come under the ſame puniſhment with her.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> did not refrain from taking and eating of the ſaid forbidden fruit from her hand, it is an undeniable proof, that the ſaid puniſhment of a Spiritual death in ſin was not as yet executed on her ſingle perſon; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof is ſo plain, that he that runs may read it; namely, becauſe the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law of that Covenant was not made with <hi>Eves</hi> ſingle perſon (as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of nature was) but with <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt place, as the head of the Covenant of nature, and with the woman it was made <hi>conjunctim,</hi> and not
<hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſim,</hi> becauſe God had conjoyned her by marriage to be one fleſh with <hi>Adam,</hi> for the procreation of their like in nature.</p>

<hi>in the day that thou (Adam</hi> the head of the Covenant of nature)

<hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:34410:53"/> Concluſions from the premiſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From hence it followes, that the Law of the tranſient Covenant of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had no relation at all to any part of the moral Law of nature: for in caſe it had depended on any part of the moral Law of nature, then <hi>Eves</hi> ſingle perſon had been firſt put under the threatned puniſhment of a Spiritual death in ſin, for her firſt act of eating before <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten, becauſe her ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was by creation put under the obedience of every branch of the moral Law of nature, as much as <hi>Adams</hi> perſon was: but tis evident, that the threatned puniſhment of a Spiritual death in ſin was not executed upon her ſingle perſon at the firſt inſtant of her eating; for in caſe it had, then
<hi>Adam</hi> could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe chooſe but have taken notice of it by the evil effects of it, and then his wiſdom was ſuch, that he would ever after have refuſed (with utter deteſtation) to have taken and eaten of that forbidden fruit from her hand, that ſo he might not come under the ſame vindicative puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence it doth alſo follow, that though
<hi>Eve</hi> was firſt in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In caſe</hi> Adam <hi>had but forborn to have eaten of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit from</hi> Eves <hi>hand, all his poſterity ſhould have been confirmed in his concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi>
                  </note> yet the Covenant of nature was not fully broken by <hi>Eves</hi> firſt act of eating the forbidden fruit, becauſe her ſingle perſon was not ordained to be the head in the Covenant of nature, ſhe was indeed under the Law of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of nature in her married conjunction with <hi>Adam</hi> the head, but not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 2 From hence it doth alſo follow, that in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> the head in that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant had but forborn the act of eating, his natural poſterity ſhould not have been puniſhed with a Spiritual death in ſin for <hi>Eves</hi> tranſgreſſion, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his natural and matrimonial union with her; for as I noted it before from <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 5, ſucceſſion by propagation is accounted from men, and not from women. 3. From hence it doth alſo follow, that in caſe <hi>Adam</hi> had firſt ſeen the evil effects of her Spiritual death in ſin, he would on the contrary have inſtantly eaten of the Tree of the twofold life, that ſo his concreated perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might have been confirmed to him, and to all his natural poſterity ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence alſo may be deduced another unconquerable reaſon, why the Law of the Covenant of nature had no dependance at all upon any branch of the moral Law of nature; namely, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eves</hi> moral perfections were ſuch, both in their underſtanding, will, and affections, that they could not have willed to eat of the forbidden fruit, in caſe it had been contrary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: for by their concreated moral principles they were as exactly conformable to every branch of the moral Law of nature, as Chriſts ſoul was, ſo that no temptation to any ſin againſt any branch of that moral Law, could poſſibly have prevailed, as may be ſeen by the example of Chriſt: for as ſoon as the Devil began to tempt him to a moral ſin, (namely, to throw himſelf down from the top of the Pinacle of the Temple<hi>:</hi> and 2. To fall down and worſhip him) he ſaid unto him, <hi>Hence Satan,</hi> Matth. 4. 10. The like anſwer doubtleſs would <hi>Eve</hi> have given, in caſe the Serpent had but perſwaded her to a moral ſin, when he perſwaded her to eat of the forbidden fruit, and then the Devil ſhould have loſt his labour; for
<hi>Eves</hi> concreated moral perfections were ſuch, that ſhe would inſtantly have perceived that ſome of the Angels were fallen, and that they were now become tempters of her to ſin againſt the light of her concreated mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perfections.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:34410:53"/> 4. From hence alſo we may ſee the reaſon why <hi>Eve</hi> was firſt deceived by the ſubtil Serpent, and why
<hi>Adam</hi> was afterwards deceived by <hi>Eve;</hi> namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this arbitrary Law, and tranſient Covenant was not made with <hi>Eve,</hi> but with <hi>Adam:</hi> and 2. Becauſe it was not written in their heart and mind, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the moral Law of nature was; for had it been ſo written, then they could not have been deceived by Satans temptations: but ſeeing it pleaſed God to hide the internal ground thereof in his ſecret decree, together with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ground and reaſon of that other poſitive Law that was given to the Angels, (as I have alſo noted it in my former printed <hi>Reply,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 11, 159.) they might the more eaſily be deceived by Satans ſpecious temptations.</p>
               <p>For though <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> knew that God had commanded all his viſible Creatures to attend on them into Paradiſe, as upon their viſible Lord, and that

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to poſitive Laws.</hi>
                  </note> God had commanded his heavenly Angels to wait upon them for their beſt good, (for the Scriptures do tell us, that God hath commanded all his Angels to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon ſuch as ſhall be heirs of ſalvation, <hi>Ebr.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 11.) yet <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were at the firſt ignorant, that ſome part of theſe heavenly Angels did refuſe to attend on them, and that God for that diſobedience had deprived them of their firſt concreated moral perfections: and 2. That they were now pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a double Spiritual death, and were become an envious company againſt the good of man. 2.
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were alſo ignorant, that theſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels had obtained leave of God to enter into the Serpent, and to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the tongue of the Serpent, to ſpeak with mans voice, and ſo to perſwade the woman that God had now reverſed his former prohibition, and that now they had a liberty of power to eat of the former prohibited Tree for their beſt good.</p>
               <p>In theſe and ſuch like circumſtances, about the tranſient poſitive Law that was given to the Angels, <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve</hi> might well be ignorant, becauſe their underſtanding and will was not created in the knowledge and obedience of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branch and circumſtance of Gods arbitrary poſitive Laws, as they were in the knowledge and obedience of every branch and circumſtance of the moral Law of nature. It was Gods good pleaſure to reſerve the internal reaſons of all his poſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ive Laws in his own ſecret decrees, until he was pleaſed to reveal them by his annexed promiſes or threatnings, or by their events. 3. Becauſe the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Angels about Gods arbitrary commands, were not obvious to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned, neither by the bodily ſences of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> nor yet by their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and rational principles. From thence it followes, that ſeeing
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were ignorant, 1 Of the fall of ſome part of the Angels, 2. Of their cunning head-plot to ask leave of God, that they might enter into the Serpent to tempt the woman to eat of the forb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is the leſs wonder therefore, that <hi>Eve</hi> was ſo eaſily and ſo quickly deceived. 4. On the contrary the moſt of the ſaid circumſtances of Gods poſitive Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> were, as it were, experimentally known to the fallen Angels; and they knew alſo that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were as yet ignorant of the ſaid circumſtances, and they knew alſo that their ignorance of them would be a ready helping cauſe to them, to ſpeed their temptations, as I have formerly noted it in my Book of the <hi>Institution of the Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt could not by his reaſon know that the

<hi>Adams</hi> ignorance of the fall of one part of the Angels, that the Serpent was too cunning for the woman: for doubtleſs at the preſent ſhe could not think it to be any other but a good Angel that God had ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe his former prohibition, and ſo to perſwade her to eat of that fruit for her beſt good; and in that reſpect ſhe committed her ſelf to the Angels truſt: for ſhe that had received nothing but benevolence, could not as yet think there were any ſuch thing as malevolence and evil meaning: and after this ſort did the old Prophet deceive the young Prophet; for the young Prophet thought that the old Prophet was ſent by God (as he ſaid he was) to reverſe the former prohibition, and to give him a liberty of power both to eat and to drink in that place, contrary to Gods former prohibition, 2
<hi>Kings</hi> 13. but he lyed unto him as the Angel did to <hi>Eve.</hi>

                  </note> men are often deceived by falſe ſpies, to make wrong deliberations, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking likelyhoods inſtead of truth; and ſuch miſtakings have often hapned to wiſe men, about ſome certain circumſtances in Gods arbitrary and tranſient poſitive Laws, as I inſtanced before in the caſe of the young Prophet, and in the caſe of
<hi>Ahab,</hi> and of divers others, which I have cited in the next Chapter; by the which you may ſee that God was often pleaſed to hide ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (in thoſe kind of Laws) in his ſecret decrees: and thence it came to paſs, that ſeveral perſons in ſeveral caſes have made wrong deliberations, and for their tranſgreſſions have fallen under the threatned penalties.</p>
               <p n="7">7. From hence alſo it is obſervable, that though there was no ſinful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in <hi>Adam,</hi> touching his obedience to Gods ſaid poſitive Law, yet there was a negative ignorance in him (as there was alſo in the humane nature of Chriſt, though in another caſe) touching ſome circumſtances that concerned the ſaid poſitive Law and Covenant, and alſo touching Gods poſitive Law and Covenant made with the Angels: and from thence it came to paſs, (as <hi>Luther</hi> truly ſaith, in

That <hi>the Serpent provoked</hi> Eve <hi>to dispute of a by-matter, touching the ſecret counſel of God about the forbidden fruit, and ſo led her away from the Word;</hi> (namely, from Gods poſitive command) But <hi>Luther</hi> could not have called it a by-matter, touching the ſecret counſel of God, in caſe her act of eating the forbidden fruit had been a tranſgreſſion of any part of the moral Law of nature; for no part or circumſtance of that Law can be called a by-matter, neither was any part of the Law of nature hid from <hi>Eve</hi> in the ſecret counſel of God, as ſome circumſtances about the tranſient Law of prohibition was.</p>

(Saith he) it is evident, that the obligation of the Law to believers (now) is exceeding different from the obligation of it to <hi>Adam</hi> before the promiſe, or the obligation on unbelievers, or the obligation of the Law of grace on the finally impenitent unbelievers: the Law (ſaith he) obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Adam</hi> before the promiſe, without any remedy, exiſtent, or revealed, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>Theſe differences doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> make between the moral Law of nature, and the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> of which differences II have alſo ſpoken more in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.</p>

               <p n="2">2. He takes as little heed to the true ſence of the word Law; for the Law that entred to make ſin abound, is not meant of the poſitive Law of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient covenant of nature, for that Law had its entrance before his firſt ſin, and it did forbid him to ſin by his eating of the forbidden fruit: neither is it meant of the fixed moral Law of his concreated nature; for that Law was alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his heart and minde before his firſt ſin: Therefore that Law that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred tomake ſin abound, was the new Law of the Covenant of grace as it is contained in the ten Commandments: This is the onely Law that doth make ſin abound to the converſion of ſouls: namely, it makes Original ſin to abound, for
<hi>Adam</hi> was no ſooner deprived of Gods concreated image of moral perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; But inſtantly his active will and affections could not otherwiſe chooſe but act irregularly, againſt every branch of the ſaid moral Law; and from thence it came to paſs (by Gods grace) that the new Law of the Covenant of grace and Reconciliation, was firſt declared in

<hi>Adam,</hi> firſt ſin and puniſhment, the Covenant of nature

                  <p n="1">1. Then conſider, That the moral Law of nature was ſo concreated in <hi>Adams</hi> heart and mind, that he could not ſin againſt any branch of it; But yet he might ſin againſt a meer Arbitrary and tranſient poſitive Law, that forbad nothing elſe but his bodily act of eating of that fruit, that was good food by creation; and of the which he had a liberty of power to eat by the Law of his creation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider that though <hi>Adam</hi> was created after the likeneſs of God in moral perfections, yet he was not created after the likeneſs of God in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obedience of his tranſient poſitive Laws, they were not written in his heart and mind in the time of his creation, as the moral Law was; but they and the internal reaſon of them was kept ſecret in Gods eternal counſel and decree, and in that reſpect
<hi>Adam</hi> might eaſily be deceived, touching the ground and reaſon of them, and ſo conſequently touching the reaſon of his obedience to them through the unſeen ſubtilty of the good Angels perſwaſion, as
<hi>Eve</hi> thought it was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider alſo that <hi>Adams</hi> ignorance of the ſecret reaſon of the ſaid tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Law, was no ſinful ignorance, becauſe it was not from any moral defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in his rational ſoul; and to this effect doth <hi>P.

                  <p n="7">7. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> on the <hi>Creed</hi> ſaith, freedom of will to that which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely evil, was not in <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency: But (ſaith he, at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 4.) freedom of will to things that are good in their own nature, and which may become evil through prohibition; This freedom of will was in <hi>Adam</hi> before

               </label> I think I have ſufficiently replyed to this heterodox aſſertion, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. where I have ſhewed, that the Covenant of nature was not made with <hi>Adam</hi> in any relation at all to any branch of the moral Law of nature, but in

            <p n="6">6. I did in my ſaid <hi>Dialogue</hi> likewiſe prove from the preface of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that they were given only in the form of a Covenant of grace and reconciliation: <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I did alſo ſhew from the four firſt Commandments, that the Law at mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was given by Chriſt, as the only Mediator of the Covenant of grace and reconciliation, for the converſion and ſalvation of believing ſinners: and from thence I did infer, 1. That it is not fit to call the ten Commandments the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of nature; and 2. That it is not fit to call the ten Commandments the Covenant of nature; and ſo conſequently it cannot be the only matter of a ſinners righteouſneſs, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth all along make it to be.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I ſaid alſo in <hi>pag.</hi> 103. That faith in Chriſt was not engraven in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, as the moral Law of nature was, and that <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency did not know any thing of Chriſt, or of faith in Chriſt as his ſurety; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the ten Commandments were not written in his heart, in the ſame ſence as they were given to fallen <hi>Adam</hi> at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> after that Chriſt was publiſhed to be the ſeed of the woman, that ſhould break the Devils head-plot for the redemption of believing ſinners.</p>
            <p>From theſe and the like conſiderations in my <hi>Dialogue</hi> I did conclude, that the tearm <hi>moral Law</hi> was no way fit to be given to the ten Commandments, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in relation to the moral Law of <hi>Adams</hi> nature, or to the Covenant of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe the tearm <hi>moral Law</hi> in neither of theſe two ſences, doth expreſs the true ſcope of the ten Commandments, as every general title ought to do, but they do rather pervert the true ſcope of the ten commandments to a wrong ſence.</p>
            <p>This is the true ſcope of my arguing in my

            <p>Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth thus anſwer, in <hi>p.</hi> 178.</p>
            <p>If the ten Commandments do require faith in Chriſt, as well as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties, then the ten Commandments require moral duties, as well as faith in Chriſt: if ſo, then they may aptly in that reſpect be called the moral Law.</p>

            <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth limit <hi>Adams</hi> ability to believe, through proportionable concourſe of the firſt cauſe; But I believe it may well puzzle his reader, (if not himſelf) to explain what he means by proportionable concourſe of the firſt cauſe; whether he means that <hi>Adam</hi> had in himſelf a power already wrought by God in his creation as the firſt cauſe (as his words ſeem to carry it) or whether he ſhould have been enabled to believe by freſh ſupplies, beyond that natural reach which he had in his creation? If <hi>Adam</hi> had already a principle to believe in Chriſt, then he needed not proportionable concourſe of the firſt cauſe; on the other hand, if he muſt yet have proportionable concourſe of the firſt cauſe to enable him to believe, by new influences of the ſpirit; then he had not already a principle to believe in Chriſt, nor could he have it as long as he lived under the Covenant of nature:</p>
            <p>And from hence it follows that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> had no juſt ground to infer from the Covenant of grace in the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt merited for thoſe onely for whom he was a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: but he did not merit any thing for Angels, therefore he was not a mediator for them: The minor is proved thus, Chriſt died for thoſe for whom he merited any thing, and his merits had not their conſummation but at his death, and 2.

            <p>This was the true ground (as I conceive) of the fall of the one part of the Angels (and of the confirmation of the other part) and not their believing in Chriſt as their head and confirmer; ſeeing Chriſt was not as yet declared as long as <hi>Adam</hi> and Angels did continue under the Covenant of meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The internal cauſe of the confirmation of the one part of the Angels was Gods Election; But the external cauſe was, as I ſaid before, their obedience to Gods poſitive Law and Covenant in attending on earthly
<hi>Adam:</hi> by the moral Law of their ſpiritual nature, they were exempted from ſo low a ſervice as to attend on earthly creatures: but it was Gods poſitive Law that did bind them to that obedience, and that threatned them with a ſpiritual death in caſe they refuſed.</p>

2. I have alſo ſhewed that the Covenant of works after the fall, was ordained for no other end or uſe, but to be as a Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt, and thence it follows that the Law of works both before and after the fall is not the ſame; and of this, ſee more in <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</p>

                  <p>This poſitive Covenant was ordained to be for a typical repreſentation of Gods Covenant of grace and reconciliation by the death of Chriſt, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth expound it in <hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 15. and therefore it doth belong to the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> but not to the moral Law of nature, in the which <hi>Adam</hi> was created.</p>

<hi>Samſoa</hi> of his victorious Spirit, and of his protection alſo; and then the Philiſtines got the maſtery over him, and uſed him with all reproach and ſhame as their capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemy: but as ſoon as
<hi>Samſon</hi> by his repentance and faith in Chriſt, had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Gods reconciliation, and that his hair was grown again, it pleaſed the Lord to repent him of the evil that he had done unto <hi>Samſon,</hi> and to renew his Covenant with him, and then he did reſtore unto him his former victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit, and then he conquered the Philiſtines at his death, more then in time of his life: but this new power and ſtrength came not from the natural vertue of his long hair, but from the operation of Gods poſitive Covenant, who ſanctifieth outward types at his pleaſure, as he did the act of waſhing in the River <hi>Jordan</hi> to <hi>Naaman,</hi> for the cleanſing of his leproſie: and as he would

                     <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s words are very general, touching the Law of God, as it was given by <hi>Moſes:</hi> for he doth preſently adde theſe words to the former, whereby we are inſtructed what we were, and what we are, and what we ought to be; and indeed (ſaith he) what we ſhall be, if we truſt in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In this cloſe of his words he doth plainly make the Law at mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to be a Covenant of grace and reconciliation, by the which the fallen ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> are created anew after the image of God in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Zanchy</hi> doth not clearly concur with Mr.
<hi>Nortons</hi> ſence, becauſe he hath in ſeveral particulars made a wide difference between the moral Law of nature and the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> eſpecially in the fourth Commandment, as I perceive by Mr. <hi>Walkers</hi> teſtimony; for, ſaith he, when learned men do call the Sabbath, and the Law of it natural, we are not to conceive, that by <hi>natural</hi> they mean a thing written in mans heart in the creation, which man was made to obey and perform ſimply as a reaſonable creature and natural man; for the Sabbath was made for man (fallen) <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 27. But by <hi>natural</hi> they underſtand that, which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34410:71"/> the very light of natural reaſon ſhews to be moſt convenient and neceſſary, for men that are now corrupt, and which ſo ſoon as is commanded and revealed by Gods word, appears to be ſo neceſſary in the very nature of it, both for mens ſouls and bodies, that without it they cannot ordinarily have any well being on Earth, and eſcape Hell, and come to Heaven after death. This expoſition (ſaith Mr. <hi>Walker)</hi> learned. <hi>Zanchy</hi> gives of his own and other mens ſpeeches, when they call the Law of the Sabbath natural: and (ſaith he) if it were ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as things written in mans heart in the creation, then the Heathen Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles would have felt themſelves bound by it, and would have ſhewed it in their practice in ſome meaſure more or leſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s words muſt not be underſtood in that ſtrict ſence that Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth cite them for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is the leſs wonder that <hi>Zanchy</hi> doth make the <hi>Decalogue</hi> to be an expreſs Picture of the image of God, according to which man was created, ſeeing he held that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in that true holineſs which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in

<hi>Adam</hi> was created, was but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holineſs, or a ſinleſs innocency, as I have formerly expounded it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> doth often declare, that the Law that commands us to keep holy the Sabbath, or ſeventh day, was not written in mans heart in the creation; of which ſee him on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="2">2. I have at large ſhewed in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> in
<hi>Sect.</hi> 2. and elſewhere, that God was pleaſed to make many Arbitrary Laws, and tranſient Covenants, ſometimes with the national Church, and ſometimes with particular perſons, for their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſalvation, onely upon condition of performing ſome one tranſient act of poſitive obedience, and that thoſe Laws, and that kind of obedience had no dependance at all on the moral Law of nature, in the which <hi>Adam</hi> was created; and from thence it follows, that the moral Law was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at mount
<hi>Sinai</hi> for a rule of univerſal and abſolute obedience, obliging man unto whatſoever poſitive obedience God ſhould afterwards require: and of this kind of Arbitrary Laws, was the tranſient Law of the Covenant of

                  <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth in the ſaid aſſertion lay an imputation of folly on Gods moral prefections, in affirming that
<hi>Adam</hi> was obliged by the moral law of his nature, to perform obedience to whatſoever God ſhould afterwards require of him; But theſe words ſeem to imply, that <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt inſtant of his creation did want ſomething of Gods concreated image, of perfect moral obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which God might afterwards require of him; But Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> affirmeth the contrary, for he ſaith in his <hi>Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

10. that if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in his innocency had been obliged to keep every ſeventh day more holy then the other ſix days, it would have proved that he had not been created in perfection of nature after Gods image; But tis moſt certain (ſaith he) that man in that eſtate was perfect with natural perfection at all times, equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to obey God, and ſerve him, he needed no obſervation of any day to put him in mind of any thing which he had before known, and which God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, his memory was perfect, and he knew whatſoever was needful for him to know or do, &amp;c. In a word (ſaith he) his whole life was a conſtant and obedient ſervice of God; and there was no inequality or leſs worſhip of God in one day then in another, for he fully ſerved God at all times; and ſaith he, whoſoever denies this, muſt needs therein deny mans perfection, and conſtant conformity to God, in the ſtate of innocency, for where one day is kept better then another there is inequality, and no conſtant uniformity in himſelf, nor conformity to Gods will; this aſſertion of his, I believe is a clear truth, and from thence I infer that <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt inſtant of his creation, was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly framed in moral obedience, after Gods image and likeneſs, that no more prefection could be required of him afterwards; and therefore Mr.
<hi>Nortons</hi> ſaid aſſertion, is very neer a kin to that
<hi>Socinian</hi> tenent which Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> doth confute; he ſaith, there is a dangerous book called the <hi>Practical Catechiſme,</hi> that venteth much <hi>Socinian</hi> poiſon, in this particular among other things, that Chriſt added to the Law and perfected it, filled up ſome vacuities in it; But certainly, ſaith Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Adams</hi> nature did not oblige him to eat of the tree of life; for ſuch tranſient, and arbitrary commands as this, have their dependance on the ſecret will of God only, and not on his Revealed moral Law of nature, in the which <hi>Adam</hi> was created perfect, after the Image of God in moral perfections.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though I doubt not to affirm, that <hi>Adam</hi> was created after the Image and likeneſs of God in perfect moral obedience, yet it is as true alſo that he was not created after Gods Image and likeneſs, in the like perfection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and obedience to Gods arbitrary Law of the Covenant of nature; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> aſſertion; namely, that by the moral Law of nature in <hi>Adam,</hi> man doth ſtand obliged to faith in Chriſt, conditionally; when God ſhall call for it. But I have already ſhewed in the former part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> at <hi>Reply</hi> 2, and
3. that it was not conſiſtent, neither with the moral Law of <hi>Adams</hi> nature, nor yet with the condition which God made with him in the Covenant of nature to believe in Chriſt, neither was it conſiſtent with the order of Gods government under the Covenant of nature, to call for it as long as
<hi>Adam</hi> lived under that Covenant, becauſe it is no act of pure nature to believe in Chriſt as a Redeemer; But tis an act of ſupernatural grace o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly, which belongs onely to the order of Gods government, under the Covenant of grace and reconciliation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Reader muſt take ſpecial notice that Mr.
<hi>Norton,</hi> in this ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration doth not ſpeak of the Covenant of nature (for he ſpake of that in his firſt conſideration) but here he ſpeaks only of the moral Law of <hi>Adams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the which he was created, and therefore, he doth in this place moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately confound the meer Law of nature, with the Covenant of grace in the

<hi>Sinai,</hi> for when God gave the <hi>Decalogue</hi> at mount
<hi>Sinai,</hi> he did at the ſame time call for faith in Chriſt; but he did not call for faith in Chriſt, when he did firſt ingrave the moral Law in <hi>Adams</hi> heart: for he did then engrave it in his heart, as a meer Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any promiſe or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Decalogue</hi> which was given to man as a Covenant of grace after the fall, then it was given in ſuch a form of words as belongs onely to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace and reconciliation, with a promiſe of ſalvation in heaven to all believers, and with a threatning of damnation in hell to all unbelievers, and therefore now the moral Law of nature in the

The typical Covenant of reconciliation by the works of the Law, and 2. The typified Covenant of reconciliation by faith in Chriſt onely; and both theſe Covenants are but one in a true ſpiritual ſenſe, (of which ſee more, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.) and both theſe Covenants were ordained for the juſtification of ſinners, as I have ſhewed before, at <hi>Reply</hi> 13. But yet they were not ordained for the ſame ſubject matter of juſtification; for I have ſhewed before, and often elſewhere; that the firſt ſaid typical Covenant, was ordained onely for their bodily juſtification from their ceremonial ſins by the typical works of the Law <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and 2. It was ordained to be for a typical pattern of true juſtification, from moral ſins, to ſuch perſons only as do truly believe in Chriſt, the procuring cauſe of Gods atonement; But the falſe Apoſtles did not mark this diſtinction between the typical, and the typified juſtification, but they did confound them: for they taught believing Gentiles, that their legal juſtification, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works of the Law was of neceſſity to be obſerved, together, with their faith in Chriſt, for the juſtification of their ſouls from moral ſins, or elſe that they could not be ſaved, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth tell them that this typical Covenant of works did engender to bondage, and thereupon he did exhort the believing Gentiles to ſtand faſt in that liberty, wherewith Chriſt had made them free from that yoak of bondage (the obſervation of Levitical works) and thence it follows, that juſtification from moral ſins belonged to ſuch only as have faith in Chriſt; and in this reſpect the Apoſtle called ſuch as held juſtification from moral ſins, by faith in Chriſt only, the children of the free-woman.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In caſe the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> had been ſtill in being as the matter of a ſinners juſtification, then the Apoſtle ſhould have called them, three Covenants; or elſe he did much forget himſelf, when he called them but two Covenants, in the point of juſtification; but ſeeing he doth call them, but two Covenants, it doth from thence follow, that the Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> is none of thoſe two, and therefore it is an undeniable proof that the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> is extinguiſhed, and not now in being.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

As the blood of bulls did procure Gods atonement for the formal juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their bodies, from the guilt of their ceremonial ſins; ſo the bloody death and ſacrifice of Chriſt, which he performed in perfection of obedience to his Fathers will, <hi>Ebr.</hi> 10. is much more meritorious to procure Gods atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and forgiveneſs, for the formal juſtification of all believers from the guilt of all their moral ſins, and ſo to the obtaining of the heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>

<hi>Woodbridge;</hi> If God (ſaith he) by vertue of that Covenant made with
<hi>Adam,</hi> doth ſtand ſtill engaged to give life (ſuppoſing ſatisfaction to be made for diſobedience) then doth that covenant made with
<hi>Adam,</hi> ſtand ſtill in force, as the onely way to life; and then men (at leaſt the elect) are legally in ſtrict juſtice, as innocent as if they had never ſinned; both which (ſaith he) are deſperately falſe and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the very foundations of faith; And ſaith he, in <hi>pag.</hi> 252. Chriſt died not to repair the old Covenant, nor by removing hinderances to make us capeable of the influences of life and love, in that way in the which they ſhould have been derived to us, by the firſt Covenant; But therefore died he, that by means of death, for the redemption of tranſgreſſions, he might become the new and living way, through which we might come to God by faith, and partake of life and remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Ebr.</hi> 9. 15. with <hi>Ebr.</hi> 10. 17, 20, 22.</p>
                  <p>But the ſaid new and living way is not oppoſed to the firſt Covenant made with <hi>Adam;</hi> But onely to the old typical Covenant of works, that was made with the national Church at mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> which is now aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt; and ſo conſequently, there is no other Covenant, neither now nor heretofore in force, for juſtification and ſalvation, but the new Covenant onely, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33. the Law of nature was never given as a Covenant of juſtification, for an eternal life in heaven, as I have ſhewed, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34410:84"/> then he muſt have made a voyage into the earthly paradiſe of <hi>Eden</hi> to fulfil the command of that Covenant by eating of the tree of life, to obtain thereby the confirmation of
<hi>Adams</hi> moral perfections, for the continuance of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life, in the ſweet contents of an earthly paradiſe; for no other life was promiſed in that Covenant; and 2. In caſe he had been our ſurety to ſuffer the curſe of that Covenant for our redemption (as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> affirms in his ſaid propoſition,) then he muſt have been deprived of the concreated image of God, and ſo conſequently, he muſt have been puniſhed with
<hi>Adams</hi> ſpiritual death in ſinful and corrupt qualities, for this double kind of death was the onely death that was threatned in that Covenant; ſuch hiddeous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences do neceſſarily flow from his material cauſe of a ſinners juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. Mr. <hi>Lawſon</hi> propounds this queſtion: Whether the propitiation of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In his</hi> Body of Divinity, c. 3. Sect. 8. p. 103.</note> which includes both ſatisfaction and merit, be to be aſcribed to the active or the paſſive obedience of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="2">He anſwers thus at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2. The Scriptures uſually aſcribe it to the blood, death, and ſacrifice of Chriſt, and never to the perſonal active obedience of Chriſt to the moral Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That yet this active obedience is neceſſary, becauſe without it he could not have offered that great ſacrifice of himſelf without ſpot unto God: and if it had not been without ſpot, it could not have been propitiatory and effectual for expiation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That if Chriſt our ſurety had performed for us perfect and perpetual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſo that we might have been judged to have perfectly and fully kept the Law by him, then no ſin could have been chargable upon us, and ſo the death of Chriſt had been needleſs and ſuperfluous.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Chriſts propitiation frees the believer not only from the obligation of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſence, but of loſs, and procured for him not only deliverance from evil deſerved, but the enjoyment of all good neceſſary to our full happineſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no ground of Scripture for that opinion, that the death of Chriſt doth free us from puniſhment, and that by his active obedience imputed to us, we are made righteous and heirs of life.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If Chriſt did perform perfect and perpetual obedience for us, then we are freed not only from ſin, but from obedience to; and this obedience as diſtinct and ſeparate from obedience unto death may be pleaded for juſtification of life, for the tenour of the Law was this,
<hi>Do this and live;</hi> and therefore if a man do this by himſelf or ſurety, and the Law-giver and ſupream Judge accept it, the Law-giver can require no more: it could not bind us to perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and puniſhment to: there never was any ſuch Law made by God or juſt men.</p>
                  <p>All theſe aſſertions of his are point blank againſt ſo many of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> aſſertions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence the Reader may take notice, that Mr.

                  <p n="7">7. Mr. <hi>Lawſon</hi> propounds this Quere, in
<hi>pag.</hi> 311. whether there be two parts of juſtification; namely, remiſſion, and imputation of righteouſneſs; and he anſwers thus:</p>

<hi>Paul,</hi> and other Scriptures, we ſhall find, (if I very much miſtake not) that remiſſion and imputation of righteouſneſs are taken for the very ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. even as <hi>David</hi> deſcribeth alſo the bleſſedneſs of the man to whom God imputeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs without works, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered.

                  <p n="9">9. Saith he, the eſtate of the party juſtified, even in this life is bleſſed and very happy: <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe ſin is forgiven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The party to whom righteouſneſs is imputed, is he that believeth on him that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, not he that believeth that Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed perfect obedience active to the Law in his perſon: for though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed the Law, as without which he could not have offered himſelf an unſpotted ſacrifice for us, yet he did it not, that that active perſonal righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhould be imputed to us, though God in his abſolute power might have done ſo, yet his wiſdom did not think good to do it, neither do we read that he doth it: the principal thing to be noted is, that this is the principal, if not the only place, that ſpeaks of imputation of righteouſneſs, and this imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is remiſſion of ſins by the ſentence of the ſupream Judge.</p>
                  <p n="11">11.

103. Mr.

                     <hi>Forbes</hi> doth heap up many arguments, to confute ſuch as make Chriſts obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the moral Law of nature, to be the matter of a ſinners righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. I will now for further light recite the judgement of two learned and eminent Biſhops, touching the matter of a ſinners juſtification.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doctor <hi>All<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

193.</note> from the matter of moral righteouſneſs, properly ſo called; and therefore he doth firſt make a common place of moral righteouſneſs by it ſelf: and 2. Then he makes another common place of juſtification, in another clear diſtinct and different ſort from the former.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Righteouſneſs (ſaith he, in <hi>fol.</hi> 35.) is nothing elſe but a general vertue and an univerſal perfection, having in it no kind of iniquity or ſin: it is (ſaith he) an abſolute goodneſs, a perfect integrity and ſoundneſs, or a full obſervance of Gods Laws. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Saith he, in <hi>fol.</hi> 193. To juſtifie, or to be juſtified, is <hi>verbum forenſe,</hi> in Scripture, and it properly ſignifies to be judged and aſſoyled, <hi>(i.e.</hi> acquitted) as if I ſhould ſay, the people of <hi>Rome</hi> have juſtified <hi>Scipio,</hi> being accuſed of the <hi>Tribunes;</hi> that is to ſay, they have aſſoyled, (or acquitted him) or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him to be a juſt man: and ſo in Scripture it is ſaid, <hi>The righteous ſhall be justified in judgement, and the wicked ſhall be condemned,</hi> Deut. 25. 1. and ſo in
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 37. <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be justified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that is, thou ſhalt be freed and delivered.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Saith he, to be juſtified by faith in Chriſt, is to obtain remiſſion, and ſo to be accounted righteous; that is, accepted to God, not by our own powers, but by the free grace of our Mediator.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Saith he, juſtification properly is no other thing then a remiſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, or acceptation of a perſon to eternal life; that is, (ſaith he) juſtification ſignifies remiſſion of ſins, and (thereby) a ſure hope of eternal life, given freely by the only mercy of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Saith he, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth thoſe things
<hi>Justifications,</hi> (in <hi>Ebr.</hi> 9. 10.) <hi>Which declare justification after a ſort, as are the ſacrifices and purifications of the Law:</hi> theſe rites and ceremonies are called, <hi>Juſtification<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> not becauſe they do juſtifie by themſelves, but becauſe they do ſacramentally repreſent the manner of juſtification by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In <hi>par.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 93. he ſaith, the order of our juſtification lies thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is God which doth juſtifie, by imparting unto us his mercy and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; (namely, of forgiveneſs to repenting and believing ſinners, as he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is Chriſt that hath deſerved this mercy of God, and promiſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſuffering thoſe pains for us, which we our ſelves ſhould have ſuffered.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then faith cometh as an Organ or Inſtrument, by the which we perceive and receive Chriſt, and with him the mercy and promiſes of God (his forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) by the which we are juſtified.</p>
                  <p>And ſaith he a little before, when we ſay that we are juſtified by faith, it is no more to ſay, but that juſtification is obtained and had by Chriſt, and the promiſes of God which are received and apprehended by faith.</p>
                  <p>In theſe three points he ſpeaks of the order of juſtification, juſt as <hi>Tindal</hi> doth, whoſe words I have cited in my former printed <hi>Reply;</hi> and in all this he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34410:86"/> hath not a word of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> matter of juſtification; and yet he ſaith in his Table, juſtification is throughly diſcuſſed; namely, in the words which I have now cited.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The other eminent Biſhop is Doctor
<hi>Bilſon,</hi> who ſaith in his <hi>Sermons of Redemption, pag.</hi> 45. By Chriſts obedience I do not mean the holineſs of his life, or his performance of the Law, but the obedience of the perſon unto death, even the death of the croſs, which was voluntarily offered by him, and not neceſſarily impoſed on him, above and beſides the Law, and no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Law. In theſe words he denies that matter of a ſinners juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> contends
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or, and alſo he denies the obedience of Chriſt in his death, to be above and beſides the Law, and therefore not to be any legal obedience: quite oppoſite to Mr.
<hi>Nortons</hi> aſſertion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Saith he, in <hi>pag.</hi> 104. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. This obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt (ſaith he) is his obedience unto death, even to the death of the croſs,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8. and the righteouſneſs of the faithful (ſaith he) is the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſins, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p n="3">Mark this I pray, that he calls the righteouſneſs of the faithful the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſins.</p>
                  <p n="4">3. Saith he in his <hi>Survey, pag.</hi> 267. God doth impute righteouſneſs to us that be ſinners, by pardoning our offences, and accepting us for Chriſt his ſake, when of our ſelves we are moſt unworthy.</p>
                  <p n="5">4. Saith he <hi>ibidem,</hi> the puniſhment of our ſins Chriſt did willingly bear in his body; the guilt of our ſins he did not, and that made his offering the more righteous (and meritorious) as being without deſert of guilt.</p>
                  <p n="6">5. Saith he, in <hi>pag.</hi> 272. God made Chriſt ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. that is a ſacrifice for ſin, by the which our ſins are pardoned and purged, that ſo we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, by his remitting all our ſins, and reſtoring us into Gods favour. Mark I pray how he doth expound both the parts of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
21. juſt as I have done in my former printed <hi>Reply, pag.</hi> 207,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he makes Chriſts ſacrifice for ſin to be the procuring cauſe of Gods atonement, by the which our ſins are pardoned and purged, that ſo we might be made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him.</p>
                  <p n="7">6. Saith he a few lines after; Even in this life where we are continual ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we have no righteouſneſs, but what is joyned with the real remiſſion of our ſins pardoned for Chriſt his ſake.</p>
                  <p n="8">Theſe eminent Divines, and divers others which I have cited in the next Section, do plainly deny the obedience of Chriſt in his life, to be the matter of a ſinners juſtification; and they do confirm the ſame way and order of juſtification, that I have all along held forth, though they are cenſured for hereſie by Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> through my ſides; but if any hereſie be, it belongs to the cenſurer: for oftentimes it falls out, that ſuch as are moſt in errour, do moſt cry out againſt ſuch as hold the contrary truth.</p>

Behold (I pray) the fallacy of his arguing; for he doth not tell the punctual time when his obedience (which he calls the matter of his juſtification) ſhould be finiſhed, whether at the end of ten thouſand, or at the end of a hundred thouſand years, for the perfecting of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: but on the contrary, in caſe
<hi>Adam</hi> had but once eaten of the Tree of the twofold life in the firſt place, he ſhould have been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his concreated moral perfections, that he ſhould never have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but have lived for ever in the ſweet contents of an earthly Paradiſe, and all his children, by the vertue of Gods ſupream poſitive Covenant ſhould have been born in his natural perfections, and ſo conſequently they ſhould never have been properly juſtified, (becauſe they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have finiſhed their courſe of moral obedience) unleſs God had ſet a limited time when the courſe of their obedience ſhould have been finiſhed, which had been to make his image in <hi>Adam</hi> changeable before he fell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gomarus</hi> agrees with Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> ſaid aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>For thus he ſaith, in <hi>Theſis</hi> 17. Moreover, neither doth the abſence of all ſin ſuffer that any one ſhould (thereby) be endued with perfect juſtice, who hath right to life, but thereto is alſo required the perfect obedience of the Law; that is, that all the Commandments be altogether, and at all times kept; by which reaſon
<hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, albeit he were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and a ſinner, yet was he not perfectly juſt with ſuch a juſtice as was required to the right of life, becauſe the duration of his begun juſtice ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not unto the end.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> doth thus anſwer: Scarce a more vain thought then the
<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> other (in <hi>Theſ.</hi>
16.) could even be deviſed: For.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As if the abſence of ſin, and the keeping of the Law, which are utterly indiviſive, were two diſtinct things ſevered from each other, or two members of juſtice, unto the which (juſtice) it ſhould ſtand as whole, whereas in very deed theſe two are coincident: for all kind of abſence of ſin muſt neceſſarily include in it ſelf the keeping of the Law; and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute keeping of the Law muſt neceſſarily include in it ſelf the abſence of all ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Saith he, whoſe denies that <hi>Adam</hi> was perfectly juſt, with ſuch a juſtice as was required unto the right of life, becauſe the duration of his juſtice ſucceeded not unto the end, the ſame muſt deny Chriſt to have been
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34410:96"/> perfectly juſt immediately from his birth, or from his begun publick mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, becauſe the duration of his juſtice had not yet ſucceeded unto the end, or that <hi>Adam</hi> alſo now placed in Heaven is perfectly juſt, becauſe the duration of his juſtice is not yet alſo expired. <hi>Adam</hi> was from the very beginning perfectly juſt, becauſe he was made of God in perfect ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he alſo remained perfectly juſt, becauſe endowed with perfect ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo long as he ſtood in that eſtate wherein he was made: and ſo long as he ſtood in that eſtate, he had both right unto life, and rejoyced even in the poſſeſſion of the ſame. His fall cut off the right unto life, not by condemning his former juſtice of imperfection, which whileſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he had both right unto life, and the fruit of that right<hi>:</hi> but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he, by cutting off the continuation of it, (which being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had not been more perfect, but more prolonged) gotten a new right unto life, but had continued that before conferred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Saith he, the oppoſition and compariſon is not made unto the ſame thing; to wit, the temporary abſence of ſin is compared with perpetual juſtice which is perfect, when as even the perpetual abſence of ſin ought to have been compared with juſtice alike continued: for who can bear one thus arguing? expurgation of ſin brings not in juſtice, becauſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſin for a time brings not in perpetuall juſtice. Yea the expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of all ſin in general doth not bring in perfect juſtice, (for ſo ought it to be ſaid, unleſs we would deny ſome ſin to be purged away by the blood of Chriſt, againſt the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7.) becauſe doubtleſs the temporary abſence of ſin doth not neceſſarily bring in perfect ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Saith he, from the Authors very grounds here propoſed (it followes that) <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had never ſinned, had appeared perfectly juſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as nothing hindred whereby he ſhould appear leſs ſuch, but that he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſinned: and therefore all the faithful, ſeeing all their faults which they have committed from birth until death, are purged away by the blood of Chriſt, what hinders why in the ſight of God they be ere a whit leſs holden for perfectly juſt.</p>
                  <p>And then he concludes thus,</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things are not onely Sophiſms, but meer prodigious Phantaſms.</p>

                     </note> his deſcention, conception, incarnation and miracles, are not imputed to us, becauſe they were no part of fulfilling the Law, that is to ſay, they were not performed in obedience to any part of the moral Law of nature, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> for he makes all Chriſts obedience to be done in a perfect conformity to the moral Law of nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the ſaid aſſertion of Dr.
<hi>Willets,</hi> it follows that the moral righteouſneſs of Chriſt as well as of <hi>Adam,</hi> was not ſufficient to conquer Sathan, and to break his head-plot, without the addition of his poſitive obedience, for in caſe
<hi>Adam</hi> had performed poſitive obedience by eating firſt of the tree of the twofold life, he had conquered Sathans temptation, ſo Chriſt by his performance of poſitive obedience to the peculiar Law of Mediatorſhip in his combate of ſufferings; conquered Satans head-plot for mans Redemption, for theſe poſitive Laws were derived from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Gods counſel (which he firſt declared, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) and not from the revealed moral Law of nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thence alſo it follows that ſeeing <hi>Adams</hi> moral righteouſneſs was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſecure him from being beguiled in his obedience to Gods poſitive law &amp; covenant, that Chriſts moral obedience was not in like ſort ſufficient to conquer the Devils head-plot unleſs his obedience to Gods poſitive Law and Covenant for mans Redemption were added thereunto; and 4. God did in ſpecial manner qualifie the humane nature of Chriſt, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his office of Mediatorſhip, with more grace then he did give to <hi>Adam;</hi> for firſt his humane nature was not onely conceived by the holy
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34410:98"/> Ghoſt. But 2. when he entred into his publike office of Mediatorſhip at his baptiſm, God added another qualification to him, by anointing him with the fulneſs of the holy Ghoſt, even with the fulneſs of all ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural graces which were ſutable, for the ineffable performance of his ſaid poſitive obedience, both in his combate of ſufferings, and in his death and ſacrifice for mans Redemption; But I have ſpoken more at large of his anointing, on the word anoint, in

As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample<hi>:</hi> The word Law in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 1. doth comprehend the whole oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> 2. Yet in <hi>v.</hi> 4. it referres to the Law of rites: for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ye are become dead to the Law</hi> (namely the Typical rites of the Law) <hi>by the body of Chriſt:</hi> for when the body is come in place the ſhaddow ceaſeth, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. The ſervice of the Law is needfull for the Church (ſaith <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi>
16. 16.) untill Chriſt be come and formed in us, and we by him do bring forth fruit unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. and ſaith he in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2. Before Chriſt came in our humanity, the Church (according to the oeconomicall diſpenſatation of God) was a child in her nonage, under Tutors and Governors untill the time appointed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1, 2. kept under the Law, ſhut up unto the Faith which which ſhould afterwards be Revealed, which Law was a Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 23. 24. in this eſtate ſhe continued till Faith came, and then ſhe being dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt was to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to another, even to him who is raiſed from the dead, that ſhe might bring forth fruit unto God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 1, 4. in theſe two cited places Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> (and others) doth make the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>verſ.</hi> to ſpeak of the Law of Typicall rites. 3. The word Law in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. doth moſt eſpecially referre unto the Ten Commandements, the motions of ſin which were by the Law, namely which were made known to be ſin, by the ſpirituall ſenſe and meaning of the ten Commandements. 4. The Apoſtle doth again ſpeak in
<hi>verſ.</hi> 6. of the Law of rites eſpecially. And 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, then he doth again relate to the Law of the Ten Commandements in <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8. Saying, <hi>I had not known ſin but by the Law, for I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> 6. Then he doth alſo referre to the Spiritual ſence and meaning of the Ten Commandements in
<hi>verſ.</hi> 9, &amp;c. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeable uſe of the word Law, by the figure <hi>Synecdoche</hi> is often u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and ſeeing it is a controverſie among Writers, in what ſence to take the word Law in many places, this obſervation may helpe to clear their doubt.</p>

               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:34410:99"/> 2. The word Law in the Apoſtles inference in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. is by ſome Writers referred to the Ten Commandements, becauſe the Apoſtle did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Ten Commandements in <hi>Chap</hi>
7. 5, 7, 8, 9. but others do referre it to the Law of rites, in relation to their typified ſence from <hi>ch.</hi> 7. 6. and this laſt ſence I believe is moſt agreeable to the Apoſtles meaning, as I ſhall explain it when I have occaſion to open <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This interchangeable uſe of the word Law, is very frequent alſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. there the word Law doth comprehend the

<hi>Moſes</hi> (at Mount <hi>Sinai)</hi> The Law was four hundred and thirty years after the Promiſe (made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3.) thence the Apoſtle doth propound this interrogation in <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. wherefore then ſerveth the Law? It was added (ſaith he) to the Promiſe, namely as that Type is added to the truth for the explanation of it, and to this ſence the Apoſtle doth expound it in <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. Is the Law againſt the Promiſes? God forbid: and from thence he doth conclude his interpretation in <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. Saying, the Law (at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> as it comprehends the whole oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Moſes)</hi> was given for a Teaching Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt, and then he calls this Schoolmaſter of the Law Tutors, and Governors, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 2. and according to this ſence of the word Law, I have ſhewed in the former chapter at
<hi>Reply</hi> 9. at <hi>n.</hi> 7. that the whole oeconomy of <hi>Moſes</hi> is called both a Covenant and a Teſtiment as well in the Typicall as in the Typified ſence of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are not to doubt ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Calvin</hi> (in

This obſervation of his touching the true ſence and meaning of the word Law, in the Apoſtles diſputations with the falſe Apoſtles, is worthy to be written in letters of gold for the better marking of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. COnſider, That the bodily works of the Law are reputed vile
<note place="margin">The Typicall works of the Law, were not ordained for their own ſakes good, but to be as a Teaching Schoolmaſter unto the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</note> and abhominable in Gods ſight, untill Faith in Chriſt be joyned thereto, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. &amp;c. And from thence it follows, that they had never been given for the bobies ſake; namely not barely for the ſanctification, and juſtification of the body from ceremoniall ſins, if it had not been to make them a Teaching Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt, that they might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith only, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
24. and tis in that reſpect that the ſaid workes of the Law are called Tutors and Governors, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 2. and ſhaddowes of good things to come (by Chriſt) <hi>Col</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9,
23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. And tis in this ſence only that Chriſt is called the end of the Law for juſtification to every one that believeth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. The Law (namely the Law of Typicall works) made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope (did) <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19. Theſe Typicall works of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34410:100"/> Law were ordained to be for a proſpect unto Chriſt: but Chriſt being come they are now to be eſteemed only for a reſpect unto Chriſt. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaith, that the ceremonies and rights of the Jews, were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of God, of ſet purpoſe and councell, namely they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for their own ſakes good, but for the ſake of Chriſt, they were added to the promiſe as the Type is to the truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is alſo the more evident, becauſe God asked the Jews in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein (when they grew ſuperſtitious in the outward obſervation of the commanded bodily works of the Law) <hi>who required theſe things at your hands,</hi> Iſa. 1. 12. Affirming moſt ſtrongly thereby, that when he made a Covenant with them at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he did not take them for his people on that

                     <hi>The Nationall Church Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted to doe the whole Law, not only with their bodies, but with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, by Faith in Chriſt, according to the true intent of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> Ex.

               <p n="3">3. After this you did again confirme the ſaid Covenant, when you ſaid unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 27. <hi>Doe thou ſpeake unto us, and all that</hi> Jehovah <hi>our God ſhall ſay unto thee we will hear and do it.</hi> Namely we will do it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true intent of the Law, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation by Faith in Chriſt; for that is the only true condition of the intrinſecall part of the Covenant of grace, though the outward doing of the Typicall works of it is alſo required, to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bodily juſtification, as a Schoolmaſter to true juſtification by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God did ſo much approve of this their Promiſe and Covenant, that he ſaid in <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have ſpoken unto thee: they have well ſaid, all that they have ſpoken.</hi> This approbation of their Promiſe doth imply, that they promiſed not only to do the outward works of the Law, for their bodily juſtification from ceremoniall ſins, but alſo to do it by Faith in Chriſt, for the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſouls from all their morall ſins: doubtleſſe they promiſed to do the whole Law, as well in their inward man, as in their outward man, namely to do it by Faith in Chriſt, the true end of the whole Law, or elſe God would not have approved of their promiſe as he did; and this is the more evident, becauſe upon the condition of their performance of their promiſe, Chriſt Jeſus was pleaſed to annex a promiſe of eternall life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>verſ.</hi>
33. And this promiſe is often renewed to all their Godly poſterity, as in
<hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 10.
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Church did again (after this) renew the ſaid Covenant in the plaines of <hi>Moab, Deut.</hi> 29. 13, &amp;c. And it ſeemes they knew well enough that they might keep all Gods Commandements in caſe they did but take a right courſe to get Faith in Chriſt. And ſo
<hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet told <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahoam,</hi> that he might have Faith in Chriſt, in caſe he did take a right courſe to get it, ſaying in 1

<hi>King.</hi> 3. 14. &amp; 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 8. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 5. And
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> declared, that it was Gods Promiſe to his Son

<hi>David</hi> doth thus pray unto God; <hi>Give unto Solomon my Son a perfect heart to keep thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thy Teſtimonies, and thy Statutes, and to do all.</hi> And ſo <hi>Aſa com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Judah to ſeek the Lord God of their Fathers, and to do the Law, and the Comandement,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr</hi> 14.

<hi>King.</hi> 18. 6. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 31. 21. And ſo <hi>Jaſiah ſtood by a Piller and made a Covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commandements, and his Testimonies, and his Statutes, with all their heart and ſoul, to perform the words of this Covenant: and all the people ſtood to the Covenant,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 3. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 34. 31.

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 35, 47, 47, 66, 127, 143, 166. and therefore in caſe it could be ſuppoſed, that any man could be as perfect in nature as

<hi>Sinai:</hi> none elſe can keep it truely but ſuch as have Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>From theſe and many ſuch like Scriptures cited in the former Chapter. it follows, the Lord Chriſt would never have given the Typicall works of the Law to be performed for bodily juſtification in an abſtracted ſence from the Covenant of Grace, had it not been for the ſake of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, that they might be for a Teaching Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt, that ſo they might be juſtified by Faith in him.</p>

               <p>Theſe and ſuch like legall Promiſes were made to the whole Nationall Church (but not to other nations) for their bodily juſtifications from their ceremoniall ſins, by their bodily doing of the outward works of the Law, and none of them might dare to appeare before Gods holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in his holy Temple, upon paine of cutting off, or of death, by the hand of God, untill they were firſt juſtified from their ſaid ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſins, by the ſaid bodily works of the Law: and the order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of working out their bodily juſtification, was ordained to be for a Typicall pattern of the manner and method of true juſtification, to the ſoule from its morall ſins: but I have ſpoken more touching theſe legall Promiſes in

<hi>Sinai,</hi> two Covenants, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. and the Reaſon of it is, becauſe it had an outward typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Covenant at Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>is called two Covenants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had an outward ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall part, and an inward typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part.

                  </note> part, as well as an inward typified part: and from thence it came to paſs, that either of theſe parts may by the Figure Synecdoche, be called the Covenant: of which ſee more in
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>But take ſpeciall notice, that the firſt Covenant of nature that was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> had no relation at all to either of theſe two parts of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as I have ſhewed it in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. at <hi>Reply</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>But in caſe the Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> had been in Being, for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Juſtification; when the Apoſtle did ſpeak of the two Covenants, then he ſhould have called them the three Covenants, and not the two Covenants.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> doth call it two Covenants, and not three Covenants, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Norton</hi>'s Divinity will have it to be: for he makes the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Decalogue at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and then of neceſſity the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue muſt comprehend three Covenants.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtle calls the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> but two Covenants only: namely, the typicall Covenant of Works, and the typified Covenant of Grace: and juſt ſo M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ainſworth</hi> doth diſtinguiſh the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> into two Covenants, in
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 10. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 3. of which ſee <hi>n.</hi>
10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From theſe two parts of the Covenant of Grace, it comes to paſs, that the outward typicall part is called the firſt Covenant or Teſtament, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1, 15, 18, 19
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10 9. and the Reaſon why that part is firſt, is, becauſe the literall and typicall part, muſt in order of nature
<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 7, 13.</note> go before the inward ſpirituall and typified part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it comes alſo to paſs, that the inward part of the Covenant of Grace, muſt needs be called the ſecond Covenant or Teſtament, as it is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence alſo it comes to paſs, that the firſt typicall part, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be called the Old Covenant or Teſtament, as it is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence alſo it comes to paſs, that the typicall Covenant muſt needs be antiquated, as ſoon as the New Covenant or Teſtament was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the death of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16,
17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. and from thenceforth to the worlds end: and therefore the New Covenant muſt be called the New Teſtament, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. or the new and living way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10
20</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence alſo it comes to paſs, that this New Teſtament ought to be called the better Teſtament, as it is in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. namely, as
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34410:102"/> much better as the ſouls eternall Juſtification from morall ſins, is to be preferred before the tranſient Juſtification of the body from ceremoniall
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the better Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the ſoul from morall ſins</hi>

<hi>the vail remaineth untaken away, in the reading of the Old Teſtament, which vail is done away in Chriſt:</hi> namely, as ſoon as the eyes of the mind are opened, to ſee Chriſt by ſaith, to be the true end of the Law for Juſtification to every one that believeth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſaid two parts of the Covenant of Grace, is exemplified to us by a double marriage-Covenant: for in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2. Chriſt is ſaid to take the Nationall Church of the Jews by the hand, in way of marriage typically: and to this ſence doth <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32. ſpeak, being compared with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. But after a while, this Nationall Church did break this typicall marriage-Covenant, by mixing the works of Idolatry, with the typicall works of the Law, quite contrary to their Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where they covenanted to take the Lord for their only God, and to ſerve him with all their heart and ſoul, by coupling faith in Chriſt, to the outward works of the Law; as I alſo noted it before in
<hi>Sect.</hi> 2. and therefore Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, after he had waited a certain time for their repentance, did caſt them off, becauſe they did not return to him by repentance, according to their Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet the ſaid marriage-Covenant, was confirmed for an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, to as many of them as did couple faith in Chriſt to the typicall works of the Law, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 60, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such was the riches of Gods mercy in Chriſt, that after he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced his Nationall wife, he offered (upon her unſaigned repentance) to take her again, contrary to his own Judiciall Law, for he had made this Judiciall Law with his Nationall Church, that whoſoever did put away his wife for adultery, he might not after that take her again to wife,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 4. But Jeſus Chriſt being the ſupream Lawgiver, did not hold
<note place="margin">Deut. 24. 4.</note> himſelf bound by that Law; and therefore it was his ſupream poſitive will, that in caſe his Nationall wife did but truly repent, he would take her again to wife, by an everlaſting Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3 1. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 60. This is alſo noted by <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 4. <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.
9. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 29. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 11,
12.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When Jeſus Chriſt took his Nationall Church by the hand, to be his covenanted wife, he required that they ſhould enter into Covenant with him, that they would do all that God required of them with all their heart and ſoul, namely, to do all by faith in Chriſt; and thereupon they did all promiſe and covenant with one mouth, ſo to do; as I noted it before in <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. and it was upon that condition, that Chriſt took them by the hand, to be his married wife in the Covenant of Grace,
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 2, 19, 20. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 1, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 6.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 54 2.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Apoſtle doth apply this double marriage-Covenant, unto the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34410:103"/> two-fold ſtate of the Church, in
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. But his covenanted wife (his Nationall Church) brought forth no children to God, becauſe they continued only under the typicall part of the Covenant, by their bodily exerciſe to the Law of works only,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But though his Nationall wife in generall was barren, yet there was a certain number of them, that did in wardly cleave to him as his true wife by ſaith: and ſuch actings of grace did flow from them to others, that many children were begotten to God by their means; for none elſe are to be accounted the children of God, but ſuch only as are converted and have true ſaith in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> doth alſo diſtinguiſh the marriage-Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> into two Covenants, ſaying in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32. <hi>Behold the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah,</hi> (i.e. with the Elected <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God) <hi>not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of Aegypt, which my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they brake,</hi> (becauſe they did not couple faith in Chriſt, to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall part of that marriage Covenant; and becauſe they did not couple faith to it, they manifeſted their breach of it, by falling to Idolatry,)
<hi>although I was a husband to them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> (by providing ſufficient means of grace, for the begetting of them to the faith, if they had but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the means, as they ought to have done.) <hi>But this ſhall be my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that I will make with the houſe of</hi> (my Elected)
<hi>Iſrael: after thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two principall Covenants or Teſtaments, ſaith
<hi>Ainſworth,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 10. Firſt, that which God made with our Fathers, when he brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the ſumme whereof was contained in the ten Commandements, written by the finger of God,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 7, 8. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 21. together with all the other Laws written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in a Book called the Book of the Covenant, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 2, 21. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 4, 7. 2
<hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 30. The ſecond Covenant (ſaith he) is the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Band, which God hath made with us in Chriſt, eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better promiſes, and confirmed by the blood and death of Chriſt the Teſtator, as the firſt was by the blood and death of Beaſts,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16, 17, 18, &amp;c. Lo here is a full deſcription of the two-fold marriage-Covenant: in which deſcription obſerve, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of it, was made for their bodily purity or ſanctity, in two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: 1. In requiring them to abſtain from all ceremoniall ſins, that might defile their bodies. And 2. in caſe they were by any accident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed ceremonially, then they were commanded to obſerve the typicall works of the Law, for the juſtifying of their bodies there-from, before they might come into Gods holy Temple. But this fulfilling of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the marriage-Covenant, was not the fulfilling of the whole Covenant, untill they joyned faith in Chriſt unto the ſaid typicall works of the Law. 2. Therefore none elſe did attain to be the true Spouſe of Chriſt, by a compleat marriage-Covenant, but ſuch only as did
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34410:103"/> couple ſaith in Chriſt, to the letter of the Law of the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and alſo to the typicall works of the Law. Faith is the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that is required to be performed, as the only hand-faſtning Band of this marriage-Union with Chriſt: and therefore none elſe are accounted for the body of his Spouſe, but believers, as it is alſo moſt fully declared in the Allegories of <hi>Solomons Song.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> is alſo more plurally called Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

               <p n="15">15. The Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> muſt be conſidered in the extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall part of it two wayes. 1. As it related to their Synagogue-worſhip. And 2. As it related to to their Temple-worſhip.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it related to their Synagogue-worſhip: there was not the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
<note place="margin">Perſons that were guilty of ceremoniall ſins, might appear before God in his Synagogue-worſhip every Sabbath day, but not in the holy Temple, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, or of death by the hand of God.</note> of the unclean to come thither, as there was to the Temple-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for any perſons that were ceremonially unclean, might lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the Synogogue-worſhip every Sabbath, as freely as thoſe that were clean, yea even Heathens might reſort to the Synogogues as freely as the Jews, as I have alſo obſerved it in my book of the Jews Synogouge diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, p. 19, 57, 58.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But no unclean perſon might dare to reſort to the holy Temple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penalty of cutting off, or of death, untill they were firſt legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified from their ceremoniall ſins, by the appointed works of the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The true reaſon of this difference is, becauſe the Temple was a Type of the moſt holy humane nature of Chriſt, and alſo of the moſt holy place of Heaven it ſelf; and therefore none that were unclean in any thing might appear therein; as I noted it before at the end of
<hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>But the Synagogue being not ordained for ſuch a holy Type, thence it came to paſſe, that the unclean as well as the clean might reſort thither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sabbath day; we deny not ſaith <hi>Cameron (de Triplici Foedere Theſ.</hi> 76.) that even the Sacraments of the New Teſtament may have a carnall uſe by the inſtitution and cuſtom of man, but not any ſuch preſcribed to them by any word of God (as the Typicall rites of the Jews had) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in relation to the holy Temple.</p>

                  <hi>Shewing that the ten Cmmandements do in ſome reſpects belong unto the Typicall Covenant of works at Mount</hi> Sinai.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed before in <hi>ch.</hi> 5. at <hi>Reply</hi> 16. that the two Tables wherein the ten Commandements were engraven, is now aboliſhed by Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7,
11, 13. and therefore thoſe ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements may in ſome ſence be called the Typicall Law of works. And this is alſo evident.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.

               <p n="2">2. It is alſo evident, that all the Typicall Laws which Chriſt Jeſus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the purifying (that is to ſay for the juſtifying) of the bodies of the nationall Church from their ceremoniall ſins, do belong to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third and fourth Commandements; and from thence it followst, hat the ſaid legall juſtifications are commanded in theſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was the good pleaſure of Chriſt Jeſus, to ordaine by his poſitive

                  <hi>Ainſworth</hi> doth obſerve, that though the people never went into the holy place to defile it perſonally; yet (by Gods po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ordinance) ſuch was the power of their iniquities, that the holy Altar, Arke, and Sanctuary it ſelf were defiled. But this defiling power of their morall iniquities, came not from the morall Law it ſelf, but from the conſtitution of Gods Arbitrary will in his ſaid poſitive Law: and in that reſpect it was, that he did alſo ordain, that the holy Altar, Arke, and holy place ſhould be purified (that is to ſay, ceremonially juſtified) from the ceremoniall defilements of their morall ſins, namely once a yeare by the blood of the ſin-offering.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:34410:105"/> 5. It was the good pleaſure of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 22. to annex a legall promiſe to the ſaid bodily works of the Law, namely that the ſaid Goat buck ſhould beare upon him all their iniquities to a Land of ſeperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; implying thereby, that the ceremoniall defilements of all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſins, ſhould be brone away from them by Gods attonement and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, and that then they might come into Gods holy preſence with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It was the good pleaſure of Jeſus Chriſt to inlarge his ſaid legall promiſe, ſaying in <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>For in this day the Prieſt ſhall make an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for you, to cleanſe you, and from all your ſins before</hi> Jehovah <hi>ye ſhall be cleanſed,</hi> i.e. By Gods attonement procured, ye ſhall be juſtified from the legall defilements of all your morall ſins.</p>
               <p>From theſe three verſes in <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. it follows, 1. That as the High Prieſt did by the works of the Law on the day of expiation, cleanſe all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church from the legall defilements of their morall ſins; ſo much more ſhall our High Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus, who through the eternall Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, to purge the conſcience (of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſinners) from dead works, that is to ſay, from the guilt of all their morall ſins, which proceed from their ſpirituall death in ſin; and therefore all ſuch of the Nationall Church as had true Faith in their true ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering Chriſt, were juſtified not only ceremonially from their legall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements of their morall ſins, but alſo in ſoul from the morall defilements of their morall ſins.</p>

But how elſe was the Temple cleanſed or juſtified from its ceremoniall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, but by the Typicall works of the Law. 1. By carrying out the Idol. 2.

18, 19. and as the Temple was cleanſed or juſtified by theſe works of the Law, ſo alſo was the Altar purified, that is to ſay, juſtified from the legall uncleanneſſes, which it received from the morall ſins of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> See <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="7">7.

But yet in caſe any one did fall into any one of thoſe thirty ſix ſins ignorantly, they might be legally juſtified therefrom by the blood of the ſin offering, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and then they might freely come into Gods holy Temple; but this bodily juſtification by the works of the Law might be done without any Faith in Chriſt.

<hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 9. there is no juſtification from ſin and condemnation without Faith in Chriſt, who is the only true Spirit and true end of all the Law of <hi>Moſes, Rom.</hi> 10. 4.</p>

<hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſſe it (after the Seventy) ſignifying thereby, that the glory of the Types of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law (which did alſo in ſome reſpects appertain to the ten Commandements) ſhould be done away, and therefore the holy Sabbath that was written in ſtone as it was a Typicall ſigne, it was done away. And from thence the Apoſtle doth inferre in
<hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
               <p>V. 8. How ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit be rather glorious? (namely, how ſhall not the miniſtration of Chriſt in his office of media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip) who is the true Spirit of the Law be glorious? ſeeing he is the only meritorious author of all ſpirituall bleſſings
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>V. 9. For if the miniſtration of condemnation be glory (which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſin to abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. and cauſeth wrath,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation

               <p>V. 10. For even as that which was made glorious, had no glory by reaſon of the glory that excelleth, that is to ſay by reaſon of the glory of the Spirit of the Law (which is Chriſt) doth excell the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Types of the Law: In this reſpect the letter and the Types of the Law have no glory, becauſe the glory of Chriſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace for the ſoules juſtification excelleth.</p>
               <p>V. 11, 12. For if that which is done away was glorious, how much more (Chriſt the end of the Law) which remaineth is glorious. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then we have ſuch hope we uſe plainneſſe.</p>
               <p>V. 13. Of ſpeech <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. And not as
<hi>Moſes</hi> which put on a vaile over his glorious face, to ſignifie to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they could not looke ſtedfaſtly to the end of that which is aboliſhed; that is to ſay, the children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> could not by the eye of naturall reaſon look ſtedfaſtly to the victorious death of Chriſt the true end of thoſe Types that are now aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>V. 14. But their minds were blinded, for untill this day remaineth the ſame vaile untaken away in the reading of the Old Teſtement, namely in following after the righteouſneſſe of juſtification of the old Covenant of works given at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in theſe laſt two <hi>verſes</hi> the Apoſtle doth ſpeak of a double vaile, one outward in the Types of the Law under the which Chriſt was vailed; the other inward in the heart through unbeliefe, and indeed this inward vaile of their unbeliefe was the only cauſe of their utter ruine.</p>
               <p>V. 15, 16. But even to this day when <hi>Moſes</hi> is read the vail is upon their hearts, namely the vaile of ignorance and unbeliefe,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 16. nevertheleſſe when it ſhall turne to the Lord; namely when the blinded heart ſhall turne to the Lord Chriſt by Faith and repentance, then ſhall the other vaile of Types be taken away.</p>
               <p>V. 17. Now the Lord (Chriſt) is that Spirit (both of the letter and of the Types of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law) and where the Spirit of the Lord (Chriſt is received by Faith) there is liberty, 1. From the bondage of
<hi>Moſes</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, in the which liberty believers muſt ſtand faſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. And 2. Liberty from the condemning power of ſin,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
               <p>V. 18. But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord; in theſe words he compares <hi>Moſes</hi> Law to a glaſſe, in the which we may be Faith behold the glory of Chriſt mediator, as it were in a glaſſe namely in the glaſſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; and from thence it followes, that we cannot, as long as we live here, behold the glory of the Lord Chriſt ſo perfectly as we ſhall doe in Heaven, when we are changed into the ſame image (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 49. with
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24.) from glory to glory even as by the Lord [Chriſt] who is the only

To the bodies of the Nationall Church in relation to their ceremoniall ſins: God Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted that upon their boily performance of the Typicall works of the Law, they ſhoud he cleanſed, or juſtified from their ceremoniall ſins; this was the Typicall part of the Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation. 2. In the Typified ſence it was given to their ſouls in relation to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſins; namely that upon their preformance of the condition of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on their part, which was by believing in Chriſt the only procuring cauſe of Gods Reconciliation, their morall ſins ſhould be forgiven them, and ſo their ſouls ſhould be juſtified from their morall ſins; and from thence it follows, that none elſe can confirm all things that are written in the Book of the Law, according to the true ſence of it, but ſuch only as have true Faith in Chriſt, being rooted and built up in him, being ſtabliſhed (or confirmed) in him as ye have been taught, <hi>Col</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>The coherence of this Expoſition lies thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt was the giver of the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai, Act.</hi> 7. 30. and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34410:112"/> therefore it was Chriſt that commanded
<hi>Moſes</hi> to tell his Nationall Church in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. That it was his will and pleaſure that they ſhould in a moſt ſolomne manner confirme the Covenant which he had made with them at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> as ſoon as they were entred into the poſſeſſion of the Land of
<hi>Canaan;</hi> and for the greater ſolemnity of their coufirmation, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ſet up certain great ſtones, and to plaiſter them with plaiſter; and to writ thereon all the words of the ſaid Law very plainly. and 2. For the higher ſolemnity, he commanded that ſix of their Tribes (when they heard the bleſſings of the Law pronounced towards Mount
<hi>Gerezim)</hi> ſhould confirme all the words) namely all the bleſſings) of the Law, by ſaying Amen at the end of every bleſſing,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26 <hi>Joſ.</hi> 8. 30. 34, 35. And that the other ſix Tribes when they heard the curſes of the Law, towards mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> ſhould likewiſe confirme all the words of the Law (namely all the curſes of the Law as it was given for the Covenant of Grace) by ſaying Amen at the end of every curſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 15. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 29. By this word Amen, all the twelve Tribes did Covenant to confirme all the words of the Law, namely both the bleſſings, and the curſes, the promiſes and the threatnings, which appertained to the keepers, or to the breakers, of the Law of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As ſoone therefore as <hi>Joſhua</hi> had conquered

            <p n="3">3. For the greater ſolemnity of their confirmation of the ſaid Law and Covenant, he did firſt build an Altar to the Lord in Mount
<hi>Ebal</hi> (where the curſes were pronounced) as <hi>Moſes</hi> had commanded, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 8. 30. with <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Joſhua</hi> performe juſt as the Lord had commanded it by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 27. 2, 6, 7. compared with <hi>Joſ.</hi> 8. 31.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Then did all the Tribes reſort thither to keep the feaſt of the Lord: for there they did eat and rejoyee before the Lord their God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By this Typicall Covenant feaſt they were taught, that all the curſes of the Law were now expiated to all that did believe, and that God was attoned to them by the true burnt offering, and peace offering of Chriſts death, and ſacrifice; as it is alſo expreſſed, in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 11. and in other places</p>
            <p n="6">6. For the further ſolemnity of confirming all the words of the Law, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace, not only <hi>Moſes,</hi> but the Prieſts did alſo ſpeak unto all <hi>Iſrael</hi> before they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſaying, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 9. 10. <hi>Take heed and hear O Iſrael: this day thou art become the people of Jehovah thy God, to do his commands and his ſtatutes which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. This very charge did <hi>Joſhua</hi> renew unto them at Mount <hi>Ebal</hi> at
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34410:113"/> their ſolemn-Covenant feaſt, <hi>For there was a word (i.e.</hi> not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) <hi>of all that Moſes commanded which Joſhua read not before all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Iſrael, with the women and little ones and strangers which were converſant among them,</hi> Joſ. 8. 35. But I intreat the Reader to take ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all notice, that all theſe degrees and ſexes of the people, are here own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acknowledged to be the true viſible ſubiects of the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace; and for this ſee further in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From the premiſes we may ſee the true manner how they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Covenant of Grace on their part.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They made profeſſion of their ſubjection to all the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the generall heads of all being contained in the ten Commandements,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Nationall Church confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Law to do it by faith in Chriſt, or elſe to ſuffer the curſe of it as Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Amen at the end of every curſe pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi> Exod. 24. 5</note> which alſo were ordained to be the rules of their faith, and of their holy life and converſation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They made profeſſion of their faith in Chriſts death and ſacrifice, by offering burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and by their Religious feaſting on the holy fleſh of their peace-offerings, with expreſſions of joy in Gods attonement, which was by the ſacrifice of Chriſt procured, for their juſtification from all ſin: they rejoyced, juſt as they did rejoyce at the firſt ſolemnization of this Covenant of Grace at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod. 24. 5.</p>
            <p>From theſe Conſiderations it follows; 1. That none elſe can truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm all the words of the Law, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation, but ſuch only as have true ſaith in Chriſt: none but ſuch can truly ſay Amen to all the words of the Law.</p>

               <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſaith in <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 22. and in

<q rend="margQuotes">"When Amen is added at the end of prayers or curſes, it is an approbation and a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, with a deſire that the thing may be ſo. And ſaith he in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 14. Amen implyeth both a wiſhing of the thing to be ſo, and a perſwaſion in faith that ſo it ſhall be, namely when it is added at the end of bleſſings or imprecations.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A more full view of the ſeverall times wherein the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church did confirm all the words of the Law, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. At Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> for though the word confirm is not there expreſſed, as it is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. yet in true ſubſtance it is there expreſſed; for at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> all the people ſaid with one mouth, <hi>All that Jehovah</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>hath spoken we will do,</hi> or we will ſay Amen to it, not only with bodily
<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 7, 8.</note> exerciſe, but we will alſo do it inwardly by faith in Chriſt, who is the true end of the whole Law, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation to believing ſinners: but without faith in Chriſt none can do the Law, ſo as it was given at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for <hi>the Law is spirituall,</hi> Rom. 7. 14.
<q rend="margQuotes">"And what elſe is the meaning of the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,

And it is true (ſaith he) there is no mention made of Chriſt, or of faith in

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Seeing the Law was given as a Covenant of Grace at Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>it follows that the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church did covenant to do it as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace by faith in Chriſt, when they ſaid, All that Jehovah hath ſaid we will do.</hi> Exod. 24. 4, 5, 6, 7,

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is further evident that the Nationall Church did (at Mount <hi>Sinai)</hi> confirm all the words of the Law, to do it by faith in Chriſt, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> when he did repeat the Law to the people in <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. they all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with one voice and ſaid, <hi>All the words</hi> (i. e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the commands) <hi>which Jehovah</hi> (Chriſt)

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. And 5. For the fuller confirmation of this Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai, Moſes took half the blood, and put it in Baſons, and the other half of the blood he ſprinkled on the Altar, and then he took the Book of the Covenant,</hi> (in the which was written the ſtatutes and judgements,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 7. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 2, 21. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 30.)
<hi>and read in the audience of the people, and then they all ſaid, All that the Lord hath ſaid we will do, and be obedient,</hi> Verſ. 7. And then in
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Moſes took the other half of the blood which he had put in Baſons, and ſprinkled it on the people, ſaying, Behold the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all theſe words:</hi> and from thence the Apoſtle draws this Concluſion, that <hi>the firſt Covenant was not dedicated without bloud,</hi> Heb. 9. 19. Now the firſt Covenant was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, to be for a typicall pattern only of the Covenant of Grace, and in that reſpect it was, that the blood of Beaſts offered in ſacrifice, and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the Book, and on the peoples repreſentatives, was to typifie the blood of Chriſt, by the which he confirmed the better Covenant, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Covenant of Grace) which is alſo called <hi>the ſecond Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 8. 6, 7. and <hi>the New Teſtament,</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>by the which he hath dedicated for us a new and living way into the holy Heavens,</hi> Heb. 10. 20. different from the bodily works of the typicall Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Nationall Church did by their promiſe confirm the whole Law, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſaying thus unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 19. <hi>Speak thou with us and we will hear, but let not God</hi>

               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:34410:118"/> The falſe Apoſtles taught, that the doing of the works of the Law by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſe, was of neceſſary uſe for their juſtification in Gods ſight;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>This phraſe,</hi> to do them, <hi>is meant chiefly of the inward doing of the Law, as it was given for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, by ſaith in Chriſt only the: true end of the Law.</hi>
               </note> but in oppoſition thereto the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth affirm, that every one is curſed that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law to do them, in that manner that was required in the Covenant of Grace; and that was to do them, not only outwardly with the fleſh or body, but alſo inwardly by faith in Chriſt: and in this very ſence the Apoſtle doth cite this word <hi>[to do]</hi> in <hi>Rom</hi> 2. 25, 26. <hi>Circumciſion verily profiteth, if</hi> [thou do] <hi>the Law,</hi> namely if thou do it ſo, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace to be done, and that was by faith in Chriſt, <hi>the true end of the Law for juſtification to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4.

<hi>If the circumciſion do the righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> that is to ſay, do it inwardly by faith in Chriſt, (for in that their fleſh was circumciſed, they did it outwardly) and from hence it follows, that faith is here called the righteouſneſs of the Law on the ſinners part, for his juſtification from ſin.</p>

            <p n="1">1. In <hi>v.</hi> 9. the Apoſtle doth make this inference from the premiſſes: <hi>So then they which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithfull Abraham,</hi> (and not

               </note> with working <hi>Abraham)</hi> the bleſſing promiſed to him in his ſeed Chriſt, was given to him before he had done the typicall work of circumciſion; yea it was given to him 430. years before the whole body of the typicall Law of works, was given to the National Church at Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> and from
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34410:119"/> thence it follows, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith in Chriſt to come without any help from the works of the Law; ſo by the ſame faith in Chriſt already come, we are ſtill juſtified without any help from the works of the Law: for now Chriſt by his death hath fulfilled theſe types, and ſo conſequently the uſe of them for ever after is aboliſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From thence the Apoſtle inferreth in <hi>v.</hi> 10.
<hi>That as many as are of the works of the Law</hi> (for their eternall juſtification thereby) <hi>are under the curſe; for it is written, curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of the Law to doe them:</hi> namely, as many as are of that judgement, that faith in Chriſt. is not a ſufficient condition to be performed by a ſinner for his eternall juſtification, except he joyn thereto the bodily works of the Law. They are under the curſe of the Covenant of grace, becauſe they doe apoſtatize from the condition of that Covenant that was made with the conſent of the whole Nationall Church at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> for then they covenanted to doe the whole Law by faith in Chriſt, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation: But you that are for juſtification from all ſinne by the bodily doing of the works of the Law, doe not continue in that Covenant, but doe apoſtatize from it; therefore you are under the curſe; for it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to doe them;</hi> namely, to doe all by faith in Chriſt, according to the firſt promiſe at Mount
<hi>Sinai:</hi> the which promiſe you have often renewed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From thence the Apoſtle doth further confute them with another argument in <hi>v.</hi> 10. ſaying, <hi>But that no man is juſtified by the Law</hi> (i.e. by the bodily works of the Law, as he doth explain himſelf in <hi>v.</hi> 2, 5, 10. <hi>in the ſight of God, is evident; for it is written,</hi> The juſt by faith ſhall live,
<hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. and not ſuch as think to make themſelves juſt by works: for in theſe words <hi>Paul</hi> doth utterly exclude all the external works of the Law, as no way coincident or coordinate with the grace of faith; for ſaith he, None elſe are juſtified from ſinne in Gods ſight, but ſuch as are firſt made juſt by performing the condition of the Covenant by faith onely, ſuch perſons onely ſhall live eternally.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From thence the Apoſtle doth proceed to a 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Argument in <hi>v.</hi> 12. ſaying, <hi>The Law is not of faith,</hi> (i.e. the ſaid works of the Law may be done by the whole Nationall Church, for the juſtification of the body from ceremoniall ſins, without any faith at all; for thoſe works of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body with water, and with the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the unclean, had vertue by Gods Ordinance, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> to purifie or juſtifie the body from ceremoniall ſins, without any faith at all, as the Apoſtle doth alſo explain himſelf in
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19, 21, 23, 24. and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13.) But the man that doth thoſe works of the Law, (by looking unto Chriſt by ſaith, as the only true end of the Law) ſhall live in them, that is to ſay, ſhall live by looking to the true end of them, which is Chriſt by ſaith.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is the true ſence of this phraſe <hi>to do them</hi> (in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.) from the Context; and from thence it follows, that it is no ſmall errour in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p n="6">6. The Apoſtles diſputation is quite another thing from the Covenant of nature that was made with <hi>Adam:</hi> his diſputation is altogether againſt the falſe Apoſtles, that held there was no juſtification from all ſin, without their bodily doing the works of the Law. The Apoſtle doth not deny, but that the bodies of the Nationall Church were juſtified from their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall ſins, by their bodily doing of the typicall works of the Law; for in caſe he ſhould have denied this, he ſhould by the ſame reaſon have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Law of works to be a Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt, but he might not deny this: and therefore that which he denied was, that the works of the Law were not ordained to be a coordinate means with faith, for the ſouls juſtification from morall ſins. And to this ſence do the reſt of the Apoſtles argue the matter in
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. 1, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is further evident, that the true doing of the Law, as it was at the firſt given for a Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation, is meant of doing it by faith in Chriſt, as the only procurer of Gods Reconciliation, for their perfect juſtification from all their morall ſins; as it is explained by theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Law ſaith, Do the Paſſeover; ſo the Hebrew Text ſpeaketh in <hi>Ex.</hi> 12. 48. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 1. and ſo ſpeaks the Greek Text in <hi>Mat.</hi>
26. 18. But the carnall Jews miſtook the true nature of this doing; they made account that in caſe they did but do the Paſſeover by their bodily exerciſe only, they had done as much as the Law required. But
<hi>Moſes</hi> Law commanded a more ſpirituall doing, namely, to do the Paſſeover by faith in Chriſt the true Paſſeover; and in that reſpect it is ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> kept the Paſſeover by faith, and the ſprinkling of blood, leſt he that deſtroyed the firſt-born of
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſhould alſo deſtroy them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 28. He ſaw by faith that Chriſt was the true Paſſeover, that by his obedience unto death, did appeaſe Gods wrath, and procure his attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for his full juſtification from all ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7, 8.</p>

                  <hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.</hi> And then in <hi>ver.</hi> 19. he makes this gracious promiſe to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners: <hi>If the wicked turn from his wicked way, and doth that which is lawfull and right, he ſhall live thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He doth promiſe, that repenting ſinners ſhall not die in their ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſins ſhall be pardoned upon their true Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth promiſe that in caſe they do that which is lawfull and right, namely in caſe they doe that which I have appointed them to doe in my Law, as it was given for a Covenant of Grace, by getting a repenting heart in the conſtant uſe of the means, and by getting the grace of faith in Chriſt, who is the procuting cauſe of my attonement and forgiveneſſe, <hi>They ſhall live thereby.</hi>
               </p>

Inaſmuch as God doth confirm this gracious promiſe by his oath: It is for the ſtronger Surety ſake to all thoſe that ſhould believe his ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that their faith might be the more confirmed in the certainty of his promiſe, as I have opened it in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. For Gods oath is as an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a thing as his immutable counſel is; and therefore the Apoſtle doth joyne them together, as things of the ſame infallible crtainty, in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 6. 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt Jeſus ſaith thus to his elect

               </p>
               <p>This promiſe is an abſolute and an imperative promiſe, and it is grounded on that abſolute promiſe that God made to Chriſt: and therefore it hath the force of cauſing; implying thereby, that they could not poſſibly walk in Gods ſtatutes, neither by their natural principles which are now corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, nor yet by the principles of <hi>Adams</hi> pure nature, in caſe he had ſtood, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> Law doth require ſuch a walking in Gods ſtatutes, and ſuch a keeping of his judgements, and ſuch a doing of them as doth appertain to repenting ſinners in the Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation, that muſt be aſſiſted therein by the ſupernatural aid of Gods Spirit converting the ſoul, and working the grace of faith in it, to inable it to flie to the throne of grace for Gods attonement and forgiveneſſe through the procuring cauſe of Chriſts ſacrifice: which Grace <hi>Adam</hi> had not in the time of his pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither could he have it as long as he ſtood in his pure Nature, becauſe this ſupernatural Grace of true Repentance and faith in Chriſt, was not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34410:127"/> conſſtent with his pure Nature. And the like promiſe doth God make in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 24. <hi>That Judah and Iſrael ſhall dwell together in the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan for ever, and that they ſhall be cleanſed from their ſins, and walk in my judgements, and obſerve my ſtatutes to doe them;</hi> namely, by faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By theſe, and the like places, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth tell us, but that we are dull of hearing, that the Doing required in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law is not to be underſtood of a bare bodily doing, but of the inward doing of it by faith in Chriſt, as the only procuring cauſe of Gods attonement and forgiveneſſe for their perfect juſtification in his ſight.</p>

That <hi>Solomon</hi> might have a perfect heart to keep all Gods Commandments, his teſtimonies, and his ſtatutes, and to doe all.

<hi>Moſes</hi> had required no other perfect doing, but by their bodily exerciſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then <hi>David</hi> needed not to have prayed for a perfect heart to do it. For the Apoſtle doth tell us, <hi>That the Law is not of faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. that is to ſay, the outward duties of the Law may be done by bodily exerciſe onely for their bodily juſtification from their ceremonial ſins without a perfect heart, namely, without any faith at all, for the effecting of it.

<hi>Moſes</hi> was given for a Covenant of Grace and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, for the juſtification of their ſouls from their moral ſins; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prayed to the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of

               <hi>By the curſe of the Law in</hi> Gal. 3. 10. <hi>is meant the eternal curſe of the Covenant of grace, and not the curſe of the Covenant of nature, as</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Norton <hi>doth confound it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I Have abundantly proved, that the Law at mount
<hi>Sinai</hi> was not at all given for the Law of the Covenant of nature, but for the Law of the Covenant of grace and reconciliation only, to the comfort of all thoſe ſinners that do beleeve in Chriſt to be the procuring cauſe of his Fathers attonement and forgiveneſs to their ſouls; and to the terrour of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From thence it followes, that all the curſes of
<hi>Moſes</hi> Law doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſaid Covenant of grace, either as temporary chaſtiſements for ſinne, to bring them to repentance; or for the tryall of the graces of the godly; or elſe as proper vindicative puniſhments begun here and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereafter in the flames of Hell upon all unbeleevers.</p>

<hi>Reply</hi> 8. from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Lawſon,</hi> That all the penalties on
<hi>Cain,</hi> the old world, and the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> and the reſt; were penalties as threatned by, ſo inflicted upon ſinne by God Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers; and ſo conſequently not for ſinne againſt the Covenant of nature.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I have ſhewed in that cited place, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Ed. Holyoke</hi> doth affirm the ſame thing: he ſaith we may underſtand by the proceſſe of the holy ſtory, that the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> never were, nor are plagued for not doing a Covenant of works, but for deſpiſing Chriſt, his Goſpel and Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I have alſo ſhewed in <hi>Ch.</hi> 8. at n<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 6. that after the captivity, when the National Church did renew the Covenant of grace that was made with their Fathers, they did then enter into a curſe and into an oath, to walk in Gods Law that was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of God, to obſerve and doe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34410:139"/> all the Commandements of the Lord, and his judgements, and his ſtatutes, <hi>Neh</hi> 10. 29. compared with
<hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 38. But it were too groſſe ignorance in any to affirm, that they entred into this ſolemne curſe and oath, to doe all the Law of
<hi>Moſes</hi> by their bodily exerciſe only; doubtleſſe they did by this curſe and oath, bind themſelves and their poſterity to doe all the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it was given to them for a Covenant of grace and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely to doe it by faith in Chriſt, as the only procuring cauſe of Gods reconciliation: and from thence it followes, that whoſoever among them did dye before they had gotten faith in Chriſt, did dye in their ſins, and alſo under the eternall curſe of that Covenant: and to this ſence doth <hi>Ainſw,</hi> expound it in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19.
<q rend="margQuotes">"The death and curſe there threatned (ſaith he) was for refuſing Chriſt, and ſeeking to be juſtified by the works of the Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. It is further evident, that the whole National Church of ſuch as were alive at that preſent, and of ſuch as ſhould be born of them in future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are all put under the curſe of the Covenant of grace, in caſe they did not perform the condition that was required to be performed on their part by Beleeving in Chriſt who was the only procuring cauſe of Gods at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement: for thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to them in

            <p>Hence obſerve:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Oath doth oblige both ſides to keep the conditions of the Covenant that did appertain to each party.</p>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>When he heareth the words of this Oath</hi> (called alſo <hi>the curſe</hi> in

<hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Jehovah will ſeparate him unto evill out of all the Tribes of Iſrael, according to all the curſes of the Covenant that are written in this Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the curſes that are written in this Law, are firſt temporall curſes, many of which are expreſſed in <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. and in
<hi>Deut.</hi> 28. and 2. the Eternal curſe of Hell torments is threatned to all ſuch as dye without faith in the

<hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 19.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38, 39.</p>
            <p n="5">5. After they were come into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> to all the curſes of the Law, in caſe they did not obſerve it as it was given for a Covenant of Grace by faith in Chriſt, the true end of the whole Law, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 8. 30, 34, 35. which I have handled more at large in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The curſe that is denounced by the Prophet
<hi>Jeremy</hi> in <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 3, 4, 8, 10. is no other but the curſe of the Covenant of Grace: ſaying, <hi>Curſed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this Covenant:</hi> But they could not
<note place="margin">Jer. 11. 3, 4, 8.</note> obey it without faith in Chriſt: and in that reſpect it is that faith is called, <hi>The obedience of faith in Rom.</hi> 1. 5. Therefore where there is no faith in Chriſt, there is no obedience that is accepted of God: and hence it follows, that in caſe it could be ſuppoſed that any ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> could by their natural principles keep the whole Law as perfectly as <hi>Adam</hi> did in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, yet that obedience could not free them from the eternal curſe of the Law, becauſe that obedience is not the obedience that is required in the Covenant of Grace, no other obedience but faith in Chriſt, who is the onely procuring cauſe of Gods attonement, was ordained to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be performed on mans part for the fulfilling of the Covenant of Grace: therefore no other obedience to the Law but what is joyned with faith in Chriſt, hath the promiſe of life annexed unto it. And therefore in the ſecond place, the Lord ſaid by <hi>Jeremy</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>I commanded your Fathers in the day that I brought them out of the Land of Aegypt, ſaying, Obey the words of this Covenant, and doe them according to all which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, ſo ſhall ye be my people, and I will be your God: Yet</hi> (in <hi>ver.</hi> 8.) <hi>they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: Therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> that is to ſay, all the curſes of it (as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. and in <hi>Deuter.</hi> 29.
21.)</p>
            <p n="7">7 All the puniſhments that are threatned in
<hi>Levit.</hi> 26. are no other but the puniſhments of the Covenant of Grace; becauſe they are ſaid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted to fulfill the quarrel of the Covenant, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 25. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus ſhall come at the end of the world in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
2 Theſ. 1. 8. All are bound by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace to believe in Chriſt, and therefore all ſuch as live in ſinne in the Church without repentance, and all Apoſtatized Idolaters, ſhall feel the flaming fire of Gods vengeance, becauſe they obey not the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I have in Chapter third given two Arguments, to prove, That Chriſt as Mediatour, is the Author both of the Reſurrection, and alſo of the final ſentence at the laſt judgement in relation to the breach of the Covenant of Grace by unbelief: and that the whole world ſhall in that reſpect be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the condition required of them in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18, 36. <hi>John</hi> 5. 24. therefore ſeeing faith in Chriſt is the principal
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34410:140"/> condition that is required of ſinners for the keeping of the Law, and ſeeing faith in Chriſt is the chief ſinne that breaks the Covenant of Grace finally: thence it follows, that it muſt needs be a great errour to hold, that any ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall be judged to an eternal death in hell for the breach of the Covenant of Nature that was made with <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. The Lord is ſaid to be <hi>wroth with the Jews, becauſe they were not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in their hearts by faith in Chriſt,</hi> Jer. 9. 25, 26. And it was for the want of faith in Chriſt, that the National Church was broken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. And it was for the want of faith that he ſound fault with them, as I have formerly expounded
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9. And for that cauſe it is that he hath caſt them out,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30. And it was for the want of faith in Chriſt, that they could not ſtedfaſtly look to the End of thoſe types which are now aboliſhed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 13. All the curſes of the Covenant of Grace, are now fallen upon that Apoſtate Church, becauſe they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear to believe in Chriſt, the true End and Scope of all
<hi>Moſes</hi> Laws for their juſtification from all ſins to every one that believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4.</p>

               <q rend="margQuotes">"Therefore Obedience unto the Law of works is that which the Surety ought to pay.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. There are many notable errours both in his Aſſumption and Concluſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a notable errour to call the Covenant of Nature made with <hi>Adam,</hi> the Law of works in the plural, ſeeing it required no more but one work or act of eating of the Tree of the two-fold life for the fulfilling of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is another notable errour, to make Chriſt as Mediator to be <hi>Adams</hi> Surety in the Covenant of Nature, ſeeing that Covenant was made with no other perſon but with <hi>Adam</hi> and his natural poſterity only. And, 2. For no other act of obedience, but for his once eating onely of the tree of the two-fold life. And, 3. The ſaid Covenant was totally extinguiſhed as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had but taſted of the forbidden fruit, and had but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the threatned puniſhment of a two-fold ſpiritual death. His Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Concluſion is therefore fallen to the ground, ſeeing they are built but upon meer fictions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I reply further for the ſake of ſuch as doe hold as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Norton</hi> doth, namely, that the Covenant of Nature is yet in being, and that it was made in Relation to <hi>Adams</hi> obedience to the moral Law of his nature: But in that ſence, I ſay alſo that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Nortons</hi> Aſſumption is exceeding erroneous: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he puts no difference between a ſurety for debt of goods, and a ſurety that doth undertake both to perform obedience, and to ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that belongs to a capital delinquent, though no ſuch ſurety is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by the Law of God or man. For it is a received maxime among judicious Lawyers,
<q rend="margQuotes">"That no juſt Law doth admit any one to be a Surety for a delinquent either to performe his perſonal obedience, or to ſuffer his perſonal puniſhment in the very <hi>idem</hi> or kind, of paiment, as is done

And, 2. That as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſſed that Covenant by eating of the forbidden fruit, and had received the threatned puniſhment of a double ſpiritual death, that Covenant was wholly extinguiſhed for ever after. And,
3. Thence it follows, that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34410:146"/> Chriſt could not be <hi>Adams</hi> Surety, to ſuffer that kind of ſpiritual death by the conſtitution of the onely wiſe and juſt God: therefore all thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p n="2">2. I do as much wonder at his negative aſſertion, in denying, that we are not redeemed by way of meer price, ſeeing the bleſſed Scriptures doe ſo plainly aſſert it. Firſt, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. 1 Cor. 7. 23. And

                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:34410:147"/> 7. The Law of God doth alſo teach the ſame Rule of juſtice; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in two caſes, 1. In the caſe of murther: And, 2. In the caſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 1.
<hi>Maymony</hi> ſaith in the caſe of murther,
<q rend="margQuotes">"That the Judges are warned to take no Ranſome of the murtherer, although he could give all the wealth in the world: and though the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of blood ſhould be willing to free him: for the ſoul of him that is killed is not the poſſeſſion of the avenger of blood, but the poſſeſſion of the holy bleſſed God.</q> See

8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 17. From hence it follows, that ſeeing God forbad the Judges of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> to accept of any ſatisfaction for the murthereds life, they were alſo prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to admit of any ſurety for the Redemption of the murtherers life: and that nothing elſe but the murtherers own death could ſatisfie the juſtice of that Law, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 31. Yea God commanded a murtherer to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Altar, and to be put to death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 14. and yet the Altar was ordained to be a place of Suretiſhip to the manſlayer, but not to the murtherer. <hi>Thargum Jeruſalemi</hi> expoundeth it thus,
<q rend="margQuotes">"Though he be the Highprieſt who ſtandeth and miniſtreth before me; from thence ye ſhall take him and kill him: And even <hi>Joab</hi> the General was by the ſentence of

               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The Law of God did prohibit the Judges to accept of any ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and ſo conſequently of any ſurety) for the manſlayer,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 32. <hi>Ye ſhall take no ſatisfaction for him that is fled to the City of his Refuge, that he ſhould come again to dwell in the Land, untill the death of the Highprieſt:</hi> But I pray take notice, that this Law was not given from the moral Law of nature, nor yet from the judicial Laws of other Nations, but it was given as a poſitive Law onely: and the reaſon thereof is, becauſe it was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a typical Law to the National Church onely, whiles they lived in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for that Land, and people, and many of their Laws were typical, untill Chriſt had finiſhed Treſpaſſe-offerings, and ended Sin-offerings, and all other types by his death; and untill his death they were ordained to be a teaching Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt: and then that National Church was no longer to be accounted for the peculiar people of God: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> to be any longer accounted for Gods holy Land, neither were the typical Laws to be any longer continued as a teaching Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This poſitive Law concerning the manſlayer is the more remarkable, becauſe he was commanded to continue in exile, untill the death of the Highprieſt: and it was in that reſpect that the Judges were forbidden to accept of any kind of Surety for his reſtitution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Law was ſo ſtrictly to be obſerved, that in caſe the manſlayer did preſume to go never ſo little from the border of his City of Refuge, the avenger of blood might kill him, if he met him, and no blood ſhould be imputed to him for it: or as the <hi>LXX</hi> render it, the avenger of blood ſhould not be guilty of bloodſhed; no, though the manſlayer had been acquitted of wilfull murder by the ſentence of the Judges, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The juſtice of this poſitive Law is the more remarkable, becauſe it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34410:147"/> is ſo exceedingly different from the juſtice of the Laws of all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for in other Nations when a mankiller is proved to be no more, but an unwitting manſlayer, he is acquitted from murther, and from death, and from impriſonment alſo at the very firſt ſeſſions of juſtice: and this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference doth make this kind of poſitive Law to be the more evident type of our Redemption from ſin and death, by the bodily death of our High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it doth alſo ſollow, that ſeeing this poſitive Law did prohibit the Judges to accept of any kind of ſurety for the redemption of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer from his exile: That the way of Gods juſtice for our redemption from ſinne, is not framed to the ordinary way of legal Court-juſtice that is uſed in any Nation; much leſſe is it framed to the courſe of juſtice, that is uſed againſt ſureties for debts of goods: neither can any exemplification be made of it from the courſe of juſtice that is uſed in any well governed Nation in the world, but by the Jews poſitive Laws while they lived in a National Church in <hi>Canaan.</hi> Therefore the manner of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Nortons</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is very dangerous, in that he doth parallel the way of Gods juſtice (though he doth not make a right parallel) in the point of mans redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, to the ordinary courſe of juſtice that is uſed in other Nations, to the utter confounding of his Reader in this bleſſed truth, as I have noted it more at large in

                  <p>From the ſaid aſſertions of <hi>Grotius</hi> and others, it follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the truer opinion is, that no man can become a ſurety, by inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his life to be taken away for the fault of capital delinquents, becauſe no man hath right over his own life; and therefore thoſe examples which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

<hi>pag.</hi> 131, 132, 133. though they paſt for good juſtice in his erroneous judgements: and that God by the like juſtice did puniſh Chriſt as the Surety of the Elect, (by imputing their ſinnes to him,) with the vindicative puniſhments of the Covenant of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (which was a twofold ſpiritual death,) and alſo with the vindiea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive puniſhments of the Covenant of grace, by inflicting on him the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial torments of Hell, which are due to no others by Gods Law, but to unbelievers only: yet it will not paſſe for good juſtice by the Rules afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though he hath cited <hi>Grotius</hi> for the confirmation of his ſaid aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet now he may ſee, that I have cited <hi>Grotius</hi> (in his after-conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to be point-blank againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Norton</hi> doth acknowledge that
<hi>Grotius</hi> is a man that doth excell in this kind of learning, he ought to take the more notice of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed judgement.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That God (according to <hi>Grotius</hi> judgement) cannot by the Rules of his juſtice, puniſh Chriſt as a ſinner, with any proper puniſhments, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he can make it appear, that Chriſt was a true perſonall ſinner: for <hi>Grotius</hi> doth affirme,
<q rend="margQuotes">"that the merit of true puniſhment is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall.</q>

                  <p>But becauſe <hi>Ahab</hi> did not obſerve this poſitive command of Gods ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream will, thence it came to paſſe that the Prophet told <hi>Ahab, That for his ſaid perſonal diſobedience, his life ſhould go for Benhadads life.</hi> And to this very ſence doth our larger Annotat. expound it in <hi>verſ.</hi> 42. where it doth parallel <hi>Sauls</hi> diſobedience in ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> to this diſobedience of

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore this inſtance is no proof at all that God did appoint <hi>Ahab</hi> to be <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſurety, no more than

                  <p>This kind of unity I do not like: and therefore I ſaid to him in my Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue <hi>p</hi> 146. It paſſeth my underſtanding to conceive how God can impute the act of Chriſts obedience in his Mediatoriall ſacrifice to believers as their act, ſeeing Chriſt did actuate his death as it was made a ſacrifice, by the cooperation and joint conſent of both his natures, (unleſs he doe firſt make us to be one perſon with Chriſt in the perſonal unity of both his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,) ſeeing Chriſt did actuate his ſacrifice by his Eternal Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and how that action can be imputed to us as our act, I ſee not; neither can I ſee how any of the actions of Chriſt can be imputed to believers as their actions.</p>
                  <p>You may as well ſay, that the Actions of the head ought to be imputed to the hand or to the foot as their proper actions, as ſay the mediatoriall acts of obedience which were done by Chriſt our head, are imputed to each member of his miſticall body: and yet I do freely acknowledg, that the actions which are done by the head, are done for the good and benefit of each ſeverall member of the body, by reaſon of their naturall union with the head, as fully and as effectually as if every member had done the ſame actions of the head.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in like ſort our bleſſed Mediator (as he is the miſticall head of
<note place="margin">But for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confutation</note> all believers in the Covenant of Grace) took care to doe all and every act
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34410:152"/> of mediatoriall obedience, that might procure his Fathers attonement

            <p n="1">1. THis verſe is the firſt Declaration of Gods Eternall Counſell, or of his Eternall Covenant and decree, touching the way of Fallen mans Redemption from the head-plot of Sathan.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Hebrew word which we tranſlate <hi>the Decree,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. is by the Chaldee rendred The Covenant of God: namely the internall and Eternall Covenant of the bleſſed Trinity, touching the way and means of mans Redemption in their order of working it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this Declaration God doth proclaim a double warlike combate of enmity: 1. Between the Devil and the believing woman, as the mother of all her beleeving ſeed. And 2. Between the Devils ſeed, and one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſeed of this poor deceived woman.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Declaration in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. muſt be conſidered as the foundation-Scripture, unto the which all the other Scriptures that ſpeak of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34410:154"/> (by Chriſt the ſeed of the woman) muſt be referred as unto their prime and principall ſtandard, for the tryall of their true ſence and meaning, for this declaration of the ſecond combate, is a perfect declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true way and means of mans Redemption: and therefore no new way or matter muſt be added thereunto in the expoſition of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture that doth ſpeak of the ſufferings and death of Chriſt, (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Norton</hi> preſumes to doe) neither muſt any thing be detracted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from (as <hi>Socinus</hi> preſumes to doe,) But all Chriſts ſufferings in all the other Scriptures, muſt be expounded to proceed from Sathans warlike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity as it is here firſt declared; Therefore all the other Scriptures that ſpeak of the ſufferings of Chriſt, muſt have their dependance upon this firſt Declaration for their genuine ſence and meaning, and ſo conſequently this Scripture of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3 15. muſt be regarded and marked as the definitive declaration of Gods will, touching the true nature of Chriſts ſufferings for mans Redemption.</p>
            <p>But firſt I will ſpeak a little of Gods declaration of the firſt warlike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; <hi>[I will put Enmity between thee and the woman.]</hi> This declaration of the firſt warlike combate, was directed againſt the Devill which was as yet abiding in the Serpent, and in that reſpect it was denounced againſt him with terrour: But yet becauſe it was delivered in the hearing of our firſt parents, it did in that reſpect imply a moſt comfortable promiſe to
<note place="margin">Gods declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt warlike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but yet us it was delivered in the hearing of our fallen pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, it implied a promiſe of grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to them.</note> them, that they ſhould be converted from their amity with Sathan, to be now at enmity with him, and that they ſhould be the ſupplies of Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace, get the victory over their potent and warlike enemy Sathan.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This threatning implies as if God had in more words ſaid thus: Thou Sathan haſt by thy ſpecious Temptations deceived this woman to eat of the forbidden fruit, and by her means thou haſt alſo deceived <hi>Adam</hi> to eat thereof; and by that act of eating they are now fallen under the death of the Covenant of nature: 1. By being deprived of my concreated image of their morall perfections: And 2. In the want thereof they are now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under another ſpirituall death of a new ſinning quality, even againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very branch of the eternall morall Law of nature, and in that reſpect thou haſt made them thy conquered captives to doe thy will at thy pleaſure: But yet nevertheleſs I doe now by this declaration of mine, denounce a warlike enmity on the womans part againſt thee, for I will now by the powerfull operation of my holy Spirit, put ſuch a new principle of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like enmity into this poor deceived woman, that thereby ſhe ſhall be able to conquer thee in all thy future temptations; and being thus Re-created by my Spirit, ſhe ſhall be redeemed from thy power, and as many others as ſhall be begotten by her faith to beleeve in the ſeed of the woman.</p>
            <p>But for the better underſtanding of the true ſence and meaning of this bleſſed Declaration, and of the new Covenant of Grace and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, I will 1. obſerve the parts of this Text, and then 2. I will expound the words.</p>
            <p>The parts are four:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods cauſing of a warlike enmity in the deceived womans heart, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devils firſt begun enmity; in theſe words, <hi>[And I will put en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between thee and the woman.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:34410:155"/> 2. Gods cauſing of a warlike enmity in one ſingle Seed of the woman, againſt the warlike enmity of the Eevils potent and numerous ſeed; in theſe words, <hi>[and between thy ſeed, and her Seed.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The victorious iſſue and event of this laſt combate of enmity, by the ſaid ſingle Seed of the deceived woman; <hi>[He ſhall break thy head.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The liberty of power which God gave unton Sathan, and to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and numerous ſeed, to hinder this Seed of the woman from the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his head-plot; and ſo conſequently from getting the victory; in theſe words, <hi>[and thou ſhalt pieree him in the foot-ſoal.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I will now expound the words as they lie in order in the Text.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>And:]</hi> This word is by ſome rendred Moreover or Furthermore; for indeed they are all alike copulative words, and doe all alike conjoyn the threatning againſt the Devill in this 15 verſe, to the threatning of the Serpent in the 14 verſe; for as none elſe but the Devils inſtrument, the Serpent was threatned in the 14 verſe, ſo none elſe are threatned in this 15 verſe, but 1. The Devill himſelf, and 2. His numerous and potent ſeed; the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<hi>Hiphil;</hi> for thereby it hath the force of a powerfull cauſing, and it ſounds thus much in our language: I will now, by this my declaration of a double warlike combate, powerfully cauſe to be put or ſet into the heart and mind of this poore deceived woman, ſuch a principle of warlike grace, that it ſhall enable her to countermine thy firſt begun warlike enmity O Satan.

45. 17. for in this Verſe God doth thus ſpeak unto Chriſt (concerning the Elect number,) whom thou ſhalt put (or ſet) for Princes (or for principal perſons) in all the earth: that is (ſaith he,) whom thou ſhalt place, conſtitute, or appoint for Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34410:156"/> combating Champions againſt Satans warlike enmity in all Lands: for by the grace of faith in their fervent Prayers, they have power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with God, for the aſſiſtance of his grace, to withſtand the warlike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Satan and of all his potent ſeed, as
<hi>Jacob</hi> had againſt <hi>Eſau, Gen</hi> 32.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take notice that when God doth by his imperative word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, cauſe to be put or ſet a new principle of grace, into the heart and mind of his Elect ſervants, he doth alwayes bring it powerfully to paſſe at one time or other: as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. <hi>I will put my spirit within you,</hi> and in <hi>Ezek</hi> 11. 19, 20. <hi>I will cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and then you ſhall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 27. Ezek. 11. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>keep my judgements and do them.</hi> So then from hence it follows, that untill God doth powerfully cauſe his Spirit to be put into the heart and mind of his Elect, they cannot poſſibly walk in Gods Statutes, nor keep his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and do them in that manner as they were given, for a Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation: and the reaſon thereof is, becauſe that cannot be done on mans part, untill faith in Chriſt be firſt cauſed to be put into them by Gods Spirit. A Camel may more eaſily go through a needles eye, than a fallen ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> can walk in Gods ſtatutes or keep his Ordinances, in that manner as they were given for a Covenant of grace, (no, not if they were as perfect as <hi>Adam,)</hi> untill God doth ſupernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe them to do it, by putting his holy Spirit into their hearts and minds.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This warlike threatning of Chriſt againſt Satan, did imply a gracious promiſe to the woman, to aſſure her that ſhe ſhould be inſtantly furniſhed with the ſupernatural warlike grace of faith in her ſeed Chriſt, which doubtleſſe did cauſe her heart to joy in believing that he ſhould now be furniſhed with ſuch a warlike principle as ſhould enable her to get the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over her firſt-begun warlike combater Satan: for doubtleſſe this word of promiſe was mighty, in the operation in her heart and mind, to the caſting down of the ſtrong holds of Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. And this word of promiſe to her, was after wards confirmed to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Gods Oath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16. to aſſure us, that it was ſo decreed from eternity, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 70, 71,
72, 73, 74. So then, Chriſts threatning of the Devil, did imply a very ſtrong promiſe of grace and reconciliation to the woman, and to all her believing poſterity, and ſo it may in that ſence be called a Covenant of grace or mercy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Nehem.</hi>

<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. and a better Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As the threatning of a warlike combate againſt the Devil, did imply the ſtrong promiſe of grace and Reconciliation to our firſt parents: ſo it is called a Covenant of grace in <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 25.

            </p>
            <p>IV. <hi>[Enmity.]</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Ebah</hi> is a Noun, and it is derived from the Verb <hi>Aiab,</hi> he was an enemy. This enmity muſt be underſtood of a holy warlike enmity, which was not in the womans nature now after her fall, untill it was effectually cauſed to be put into her by Jeſus Chriſt:
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:34410:156"/> namely, by his undertaking the work of a new Creation and Redemption And in that reſpect it was, that he did cauſe the holy Spirit to be put into her heart and mind, to enable her to warre the warfare of the Goſpel, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devils firſt-began warlike enmity. Chriſt did not cauſe any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like enmity to be put into the Devil at all, for then he ſhould have been the author of ſinne, and ſhould have done againſt the peace of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>for a Kingdome divided cannot ſtand.</hi> But the Devil had his enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the juſtice of Gods deprivation. Therefore when Chriſt declared to the Devil, <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman,</hi> he did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promiſe to aſſiſt the Devil, but thereby he did threaten the Devil, that he would powerfully cauſe to be put ſuch a warlike principle of grace into the woman, as ſhould aſſiſt her, and make her able to conquer his warlike enmity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Devils warlike enmity was not put into him, but it came into him from the deficient cauſe; for as ſoon as that part of the Angels which refuſed to attend upon our firſt parents in Paradiſe, (which they were not obliged to do, by the moral Law of their nature, becauſe it was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently different from <hi>Adams</hi> earthly nature,) but they were obliged thereunto by Gods tranſient poſitive Law onely, for the tryal of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in that ſingle act. Their refuſal was their ſinne, and for that ſinne God (according to his relative juſtice, in his Covenant of nature with them) deprived them of his concreated image of moral perfections: and from that deficient cauſe, all manner of corrupt qualities did neceſſarily and inſtantly fall upon their nature: and from thence began their warlike emni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the good of man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have made it evident in <hi>chap.</hi> 1. and in
<hi>chap.</hi> 4. That God did not onely command his viſible creatures to attend upon our firſt parents, as on their viſible Lord, but alſo that he commanded his Heavenly Hoſt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to attend upon them for their beſt good; for in Gods ſecret counſel, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were hairs of ſalvation: and thence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Are they not all miniſtring spirits, ſent forth to minister for their ſakes which ſhall be heirs of ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 1. 14. and for the good of ſuch, <hi>he ſhall give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge to keep them, that are his, in all their wayes,</hi> Pſal. 91. 11. and we ſee that God gave his Angels charge to keep <hi>Jacob</hi> in his way, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 1, 2. and he cauſed his Angels to fill the mountains full of Horſes and fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots round about
<hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 King. 6. 17. But many legions of this heavenly Hoſt not knowing Gods election, look onely on <hi>Adams</hi> earthly condition; and then perceiving their own nature to be farre more excellent, and alſo ſeeing there was no natural likeneſſe in conditions of their nature to make them aſſociate together, they in that reſpect were not tyed thereunto by the moral Law of their nature; and therefore ſeeing there was no reaſon in nature to make them to aſſociate themſelves with ſuch earthly creatures, as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were; they refuſed to be miniſtring ſpirits, to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour earthly creatures, of ſo differing a nature from them, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal was their ſinne, and that ſinne was the cauſe of the puniſhment of their deprivation of Gods concreated Image: and then in the want of that image, they did inſtantly act irregularly, and hated man, and at the ſame
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:34410:157"/> inſtant, they did alſo all combine together in one head-plot, to bring man into the ſame kind of ſpiritual death with themſelves. And thereupon they asked leave of God, (as the Devils did of Chriſt, before they could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the heard of ſwine,
<hi>Mark</hi> 5. 13, 14.) that they might enter into the ſerpent, to try whether <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve</hi> would be more perfect in their obedience to Gods tranſient poſitive Law, than they had been: and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained leave, they did at the ſame inſtant, enter into the ſerpent, and did actuate the tongue of the ſerpent to ſpeak ſo amicably and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadingly, that
<hi>Eve</hi> could not think it to be any other, than ſome good Angel that God had ſent, to reverſe his former prohibition, and to give them liberty to eat of the forbidden fruit for their beſt good: for ſhe which had received nothing but <hi>benevolence,</hi> could not think there were any ſuch things as <hi>malevolence,</hi> and evill meaning, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith. And thus after this hidden and fraudulent manner, the Devil did actuate his firſt warlike enmity againſt the good of man, he covered over his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the greateſt pretence of amity to the woman that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Devil had no ſooner deceived the woman with this cunning war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtratagem, but he did at the ſame time ſo prevaile with her, as to make her his inſtrument to deceive <hi>Adam.</hi> 1. By reaching out ſome of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit to him with her hand. And, 2. By uſing words of perſwaſion to provoke him to eat thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17,
6.</p>
            <p>And much after this manner did God give a liberty of power to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to enter into <hi>Peters</hi> tongue, as his inſtrument to diſſwade Chriſt from undergoing his ignominious and painfull ſufferings from the Devils inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But it was not poſſible for the Devil to prevaile with Chriſt by <hi>Peters</hi> tongue, becauſe Chriſt knew the bleſſed Scriptures, wherein God had revealed his decree for his ſaid ſufferings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew alſo that.
<hi>Peters</hi> tongue was actuated by the Devil: and in that reſpect he ſaid unto <hi>Peter, Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> thou art an offence to me, thou ſavoureſt not the things that are of Gods appointment, but thoſe things that be of men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Seeing <hi>Adam</hi> did not as yet know that any of the Angels were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Devils, he could not as yet ſuſpect any hurt from her perſwaſions, that was given to him to be his mutual helper, and therefore he did take of the forbidden fruit from her hand, and did eat thereof: and then as ſoon as he, which was made the head in that Covenant had eaten, the trangreſſion was finiſhed: and at the ſame inſtant it brought forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of that threatned puniſhment of a double ſpiritual death, upon them both together, and now alſo was the ſaid Covenant of nature fully bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and exſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. From this ſubtle art of the Devils enmity, all the legions of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels are collectively called <hi>the Devil,</hi> and
<hi>the enemy,</hi> Matth. 13. 39. and <hi>the wicked one,</hi> Matth. 13. 19. and <hi>the adverſary,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 14. and <hi>the accuſer of the brethren,</hi> Rev. 12. 10. by which titles we may ſee, that the Devil is become an irreconcileable enemy to the good of man.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In this juncture of time, it pleaſed Jeſus Chriſt to appear in a humane
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34410:157"/> ſhape, to exemplifie unto <hi>Adam,</hi> that he would one day become true man of the ſeed of this poor deceived captive woman for their Redemption; and therefore he doth beforehand denounce a double warlike enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan. 1. He ſaid thus to the Devil, I will now effectually cauſe to be put into this poor deceived womans heart and mind, ſuch a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full principle of grace, that ſhe ſhall be enabled thereby to countermine thy firſt guilefull warlike enmity: and this principle of grace was now wrought in her, by the Preaching of the bleſſed Goſpel; for doubtleſſe Chriſt did now declare unto them, the manner how the ſeed of the woman ſhould break the Devils head-plot: and in this reſpect, her converſion doth comprehend in it the whole Doctrine of Repentance, and of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of Juſtification, and Adoption by ſaith in the ſaid ſeed of the woman. And this work of her converſion was from Gods powerfull cauſing of it, and therefore the Goſpel Preached to the converſion of ſouls, is called <hi>the power of God to ſalvation, to every one that believeth, Rom.</hi> 1. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18, 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4, 5.
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 32.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18, 19.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 7, 20. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 5. 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And though this declaration was delivered as a dreadfull threatning to the Devil, yet it implyed the ſtronger promiſe of Redemption to our fallen Parents; and therefore it did work in them a ground of hope in their redemption from Satans head-plot: and the ground of things hoped for is faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. and there faith was no ſooner wrought, but it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and accepted of the bleſſing promiſed, and therefore it was a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon the bleſſing promiſed: and this performance of theſe acts of faith on their part, was the fulfilling of the condition that was required of them for the application of their Redemption, Juſtification, and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Devils warlike enmity was diſguiſed under a fair pretence of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: and this ſtratagem the Devil doth often uſe to the ruine of Gods people. The Devil taught <hi>Balaam</hi> how to ruinate the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Midianites</hi> how they might under a fair pretence of amity, intice the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to come to their idolatrous feaſts, and ſo to intice them to commit fornication, whereby God might be provoked to anger, not only againſt the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but alſo againſt the <hi>Midianites:</hi> and it was in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their guilefull amity, that God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to vex the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> and to ſmite them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 17. or as the <hi>LXX</hi> render it, to uſe hoſtile enmity againſt them. But this warlike enmity of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was but a bodily warlike enmity, but the warlike enmity which Chriſt did cauſe to be put into the heart of the woman, to countermine the Devils warlike enmity, was a ſpiritual enmity onely. The Hebrew Doctors ſay from <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 19. that we are commanded to deſtroy the remembrance of <hi>Amalek,</hi> and are commanded to remember continually his evil deeds, and his treachery, to the end, to ſtir up enmity againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſay they, it is unlawfull to forget his enmity and his hatred. See <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in Deut. 17. 14. Much more ſay I, are we commanded to remember continually this evil deed of the Devil, in ſeducing our firſt Parents, and to ſtir up a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34410:158"/> holy warlike enmity againſt him: and it is unlawfull to forget his enmity and his hatred, and therefore we muſt daily ſtir up a holy ſpiritual hatred againſt him.</p>
            <p>And ſo in the like ſort, <hi>Davids</hi> enmity againſt the profane enemies of God, was a ſpiritual enmity, when he ſaid, <hi>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee: I hate them with a perfect hatred, I count them mine enemies? Pſal.</hi> 139. 21. And ſo in like ſort Chriſt did warn his Apoſtles to be ready armed to ſuffer affliction, for preaching the Goſpel of peace to the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then ſaid he in <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. <hi>Think not that I came to ſend peace on the earth, but a ſword;</hi> and ſaith he in <hi>verſ.</hi> 35.
<hi>I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his father,</hi> &amp;c. and ſaith he in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 49. <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth, and what will I,</hi> Oh that it were <hi>already kindled,</hi> (ſo
<hi>Ainſw.</hi> doth read it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 42.) And the Apoſtle doth call the Word of God, <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> Eph. 6. 17. and he tells them that <hi>it is ſharper than a two-edged ſword,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. and that it is not a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but a ſpiritual ſword, and that it is mighty through God to the pulling down of the ſtrong holds of Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10. 4. And this ſword is ſaid to go out of the mouth of Chriſt, becauſe all godly Preachers are but his mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.
12, 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 15, 21. And Chriſt did warn his Diſciples to ſell their Coat to buy a Sword, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 36. that is to ſay, to
<note place="margin">Luke 22. 36.</note> ſpare no coſt, but to uſe all poſſible endeavours to get the ſword of the Spirit to defend them againſt perſecutions, and to offend ſuch as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to grace and goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>This is that warlike enmity that Jeſus Chriſt did powerfully cauſe to be put into the heart of <hi>Eve,</hi> and into the heart of all her elected gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>[Between thee and the woman.]</hi> This warlike threatning againſt the Devil, did imply a ſtrong promiſe to the woman, that ſhe ſhould be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the power of the Devil, and that ſhe ſhould have ſuch a warlike principle of enmity put into her heart and mind, that it ſhould make her ſufficiently able to get the victory over all Satans after temptations, for though the Devil ſhould often draw her to ſinne, yet ſhe ſhould by Gods Attonement, procured by the ſeed of the woman, be juſtified from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of all her ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As this threatning did make the Devil to tremble, ſo on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it made the hearts of our firſt parents to leap and dance for joy: for now they ſound by experience, <hi>that faith came by hearing,</hi> (namely, by the hearing of the Covenant of reconciliation preached unto them,)
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. For now they hear it opened at large to them, (though now we have but the heads of it,) how Chriſt ſhould become the ſeed of the poor deceived woman, and how he ſhould, by his perfect obedience through all his ſufferings, make his death to be accepted of God, as a moſt perfect and pleaſing ſacrifice, for the procuring of his reconciliation to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and that by this means, the Devils head-plot ſhould be broken, as to the Elect number, becauſe they ſhould be redeemed from his power.</p>
            <p>This declaration was the ſavour of death to the Devil, and ſo it is to all
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34410:158"/> his ſeed; But on the contrary, it was the ſweet ſavour of life to the ſouls of our firſt parents, and ſo it is ſtill to all new converts to the end of the world. And by this means, the now converted woman, and all her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſeed, are made able to <hi>ſtand faſt in the faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 13. 2 Cor. 1. 24. and <hi>to be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might;</hi> and to <hi>put on the whole armour of God, whereby they may be made able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil,</hi> Eph. 6. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>To fight the good fight of faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 12. <hi>As good ſouldiers of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Eve</hi> had now alſo found by experience, that ſhe was not made able to withſtand the guilefull temptations of the Devil, by her firſt concreated moral perfections of nature, and nothing elſe was ordained to make her withſtand thoſe guilefull temptations of the Devil, but her tranſient act of obedience, to the poſitive Covenant of nature, in eating firſt of the tree of the two-fold life, for in caſe ſhe had but firſt eaten of that tree, ſhe had been confirmed in her moral perfections. But becauſe ſhe did not as yet know that any of the Angels were fallen, ſhe could not imagine, that it was any other but a good Angel that God had ſent to reverſe his former prohibition, and to perſwade her to eat firſt of the forbidden tree, for her beſt food, and ſo ſhe was deceived. But yet after ſhe was thus deceived, and brought under the power of Satans will; it was the good pleaſure of Jeſus Chriſt, not onely to declare the ſaid double warlike enmity againſt the Devil; but alſo together with his ſaid declaration, to put a new pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull principle of grace into her heart and mind, whereby ſhe was made able to withſtand the Devil, even now after ſhe was deprived of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created moral principles of nature; for now he did by the new principle of grace, fight the good fight of faith, againſt the Devils paſt and future temptations, untill ſhe had gotten the Crown of life, as a full and perfect Conqueror.</p>
            <p>Seeing <hi>Adam</hi> was the womans head, 1. By Creation. And, 2. By the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> of Marriage. And, 3. In being ordained to be the head of all his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral poſterity in the Covenant of nature; Why is not his warlike enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devil firſt recorded, as the ſignal mark of his converſion, before the womans converſion?</p>
            <p>The main reaſon why the womans converſion is recorded before
<hi>Adams</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> is, in reſpect of the eminency-ſake of that ſingle ſeed Chriſt, that was to be conceived and born of the ſeed of the woman alone without the help of man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the woman had the preheminence to have her converſion firſt recorded, in relation to Chriſt that ſhould come from her ſeed alone, yet ſhe is preſently after abaſed, and <hi>Adam</hi> is exalted: for ſhe was firſt doomed to ſeveral chaſtiſements for her original ſinne. As, 1. To bring forth children in multiplyed ſorrows,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16. And, 2. To be under a greater ſubjection to her Husband now, than ſhe was in the time of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, becauſe ſhe was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>But yet it is carefully to be marked, that theſe general puniſhments now threatned to her after her converſion, and to all of her ſex ſucceſſively, were not threatned as abſolute vindictive puniſhments, as the firſt general
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34410:159"/> puniſhment of a double ſpiritual death, was for the breach of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of nature, where no repentance nor mercy was ordained for their help; for the ſaid puniſhments to woman-kind, were now threatned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation, even after our firſt Parents were converted to believe in Chriſt: and therefore they were threatned but as moderated puniſhments or chaſtiſements for
<hi>Eves</hi> humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and alſo for the humiliation and converſion of others of her ſex: and in that reſpect it is, that the Apoſtle doth tell us, that the puniſhment of child-birth doth not hinder the ſalvation of ſuch women as do believe in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. and from thence it follows, that the ſaid puniſhments were but correctively poenal, to bring them to repentance and to faith in Chriſt, or in ſuch as are converted, to bring them on to the exerciſe of their faith and repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As Chriſt did honour his firſt mother by recording her converſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adams,</hi> becauſe he was to be conceived and born of the womans ſeed alone, without the help of man: and in that reſpect alſo he did honour all his ſucceeding mothers, after the fleſh, with the like converſion at one time or other before they died, from the Virgin
<hi>Eve</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> which indeed was the higheſt degree of honour that he could beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, becauſe he did thereby make them partakers of the Covenant of grace here, and heirs of the Kingdom of glory hereafter. And ſo in like ſort he did alſo honour all his Fathers after the fleſh, for he took fleſh from <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom all mankind do come, but yet his fleſh was ſtill
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chriſt did not take fleſh from any unbelieving Parent: and thence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that when</hi> Judah <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Inceſt with</hi> Thamar, <hi>(which was known to</hi> Thamar <hi>to be that ſinne, though not to</hi> Judah,) <hi>they were believers, and repented, and were pardoned, and never after committed that ſinne,</hi> Gen. 38. 26.</note> derived from ſuch Parents as were converted at one time or other before they dyed.

<note place="margin">Adams <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is recorded by his giving of the new name</hi> Evah <hi>to his wife after their fall.</hi>
               </note> ſignal mark of her ſound converſion: yet 'tis moſt expedient alſo, that <hi>Adam</hi> was at the ſame time converted by the ſame powerfull Preaching of the ſaid double warlike combate of enmity againſt the Devil. And this is alſo evident. 1. Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did teſtifie his own faith as well as his wifes, by giving her the new name <hi>Evah,</hi> upon their hearing of this good tidings preached: for when <hi>Eve</hi> was firſt created, <hi>Adam</hi> did not then call her <hi>Evah</hi> life, but
<hi>Iſha</hi> woman, becauſe ſhe was taken out of man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
23. But now aſſoon as Jeſus Chriſt had Preached the ruine of Satans head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot, by the ſaid double warlike combate of enmity, <hi>Adam</hi> was thereby effectually converted as well as the woman: and for the joy thereof, he called his wife <hi>Evah,</hi> life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 20. But it is a ſenceleſſe thing to ſay, that after he had heard that Evangelical Sermon, he ſhould then name her life in relation to her firſt natural life: for it had been more fit that he ſhould have called her ſo at the time of her firſt creation. But then he did not call her <hi>Evah,</hi> but
<hi>Iſha</hi> woman, of <hi>Iſh</hi> man, that is to ſay, woman, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man. 2. Neither can any one find any other new occaſion that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:34410:160"/> might induce <hi>Adam</hi> to give her this new name <hi>Evah,</hi> (after he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the threatned puniſhment of a double ſpiritual death. And, 3. After he had heard this bleſſed declaration,) but only in relation to her new life from the death of ſin, to the life of grace.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In as much as <hi>Adam</hi> could now diſcern the new life of his wife from death in ſinne to the life of grace, it is a moſt ſure and certain proof that he was now effectually converted as well as the woman, by the ſaid Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal declaration, of the ſaid double combate of enmity.

12. 1, 17. By way of alluſion to the firſt warlike combate of enmity, between the Devil and the woman; for by the continual Preaching and Expounding of the firſt declared combate of enmity, all believers do ſtand upon their Guard, namely, <hi>in battle aray,</hi> holding forth the ſame flag of faith that <hi>Eve</hi> did, and warring the ſame warfare of the Goſpel that ſhe did, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>As good ſouldiers of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 3, 4. <hi>Having put on the whole armour of God, that they might be able to withſtand the wiles of the Devil,</hi> Eph. 6. 11,

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſecond proclaimed combate of warlike enmity, is expreſſed in the future tenſe, becauſe it was to be acted in a time yet to come, but in what year or day to come it ſhould be acted, it was not declared at this preſent unto <hi>Adam.</hi> Neither was the time thereof revealed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He rejoyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad, John</hi> 8. 56. but the particular time was not revealed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> no more than it was to

But the exact time when this ſeed of the woman ſhould accompliſh his warlike combate of enmity, for the breaking of the Devils head-plot by his obedience in all his ſufferings,) was firſt revealed unto gracious <hi>Daniel,</hi> at the juſt end of the ſeaventy years captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Then <hi>Daniel</hi> was at prayer for their return at the time of the evening oblation. And then the Angel
<hi>Gabriel</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>O Daniel, I am come to give thee skill and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, therefore underſtand the matter, and conſider the viſion. Seventy ſevens of years are exactly accounted to finiſh trespaſſe offerings, and to end ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in an everlaſting juſtification,</hi> (inſtead of the Ceremonial,) <hi>Dan</hi> 9. 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Three things are remarkable in this meſſage of the Angel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The exact time when the ſeed of the woman ſhould fulfill his warlike

The manner of his death, and that is expreſſed in theſe words, in verſ. 26. <hi>He ſhall be cut off,</hi> (as a malefactor on the tree,) as it was firſt declared in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Thou (Satan) ſhalt (have a liberty of power to) pierce him in the foot-ſoales, namely, to cut him off as a wicked malefactor on the tree.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The efficacy of his death: and that is two-fold. 1. He ſhall finiſh treſpaſs and ſinne-offerings, (and ſo by a conſequent all the other rites of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.) 2.

               <p>Theſe three points I have explained more at large in my Expoſition of <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.</p>

<hi>pag.</hi> 353. By theſe Scriptures we are taught, who they are that are called thy ſeed, (in ſpeech to the Devil that was yet in the ſerpent.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. The reaſon why this warlike combate of enmity, openly proclaimed in the Devils hearing was, that the Devil might not ſay in after-times, I could have made my party good, againſt this ſeed of the woman, if I had but had an open and a fair warning, as indeed there ought to be in the firſt beginning of a righteous warlike combate of enmity: and therefore to prevent this complaint, God gave the Devil an open and faire warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>[And her ſeed.]</hi> By her ſeed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <hi>Norton</hi> and many others do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Chriſt with all the godly in a collective ſence. But this Expoſition is a grand errour, becauſe they do by neceſſary conſequence, make all the godly to be co-partners with Chriſt, in the actual breaking of the Devils head-plot for mans Redemption. Therefore for the avoiding of this grand errors, this word <hi>[her ſeed,]</hi> muſt be expounded in a reſtrained ſence of one ſingle ſeed of the woman, namely, of the humane nature of Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for no other ſeed of the woman was able to conquer the Devils ſaid warlike combate of enmity by perfection of obedience, and to make their ſoul a ſacrifice in that perfection for the procuring of Gods reconciliation to the elect; but this ſingle ſeed of the woman only.</p>
               <p>Therefore the word <hi>[her ſeed]</hi> muſt be underſtood of that ſingular ſeed of the woman, that muſt be conceived and born of the woman alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of man: for if Chriſt had been born of a woman in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of generation, then he had been born under the curſed ſpiritual

And yet for all this, the Devils warlike enmity was ſuch, that he would not give over his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtratagems; and therefore when Chriſt was dead and laid in his grave; he cauſed the Scribes and Phariſees to ſeale his Tombe, and to ſet a watch about it, leaſt his Diſciples ſhould ſteal him away. And when it was noiſed that he was riſen to the great amazement of the Souldiers, by a terrible earthquake, then the Devil prevailed ſo with the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, as to give the Souldiers a large quantity of money, to ſay that his Diſciples ſtole him away while they ſlept.

<q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>Austin</hi> (ſaith he) declareth the difference between crime and ſinne, in <hi>Tract. Super Joan</hi> 41.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This word <hi>thee,</hi> in the literal ſence of it, may ſeem to be meant of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſingle perſon: but becauſe it cannot be that <hi>all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed</hi> in his ſingle perſon, therefore it muſt of neceſſity be taken for that ſeed of the woman in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. that ſhould alſo come out of his loynes, to break the Devils head-plot for mans Redemption, by his obedient performance of his combate of ſufferings, and of his death and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, by the which he ſhould procure his Fathers Reconciliation for to make all believers in all the families of the earth to be eternally juſtified from the guilt of their ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The word <hi>[in thee]</hi> is alſo expounded in thy ſeed, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18. and it is alſo expounded to be one ſeed
<hi>[Chriſt,]</hi> Gal. 3. 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The Scripture foreſeeing that God would Juſtifie the heathen through faith, preached before the Goſpel unto Abraham: ſaying, in thee ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> 1. Mark this, that the promiſe which God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is called the preaching of the Goſpel. 2. But yet it is a point of wiſe conſideration, how to parallel the threatning of the Devil in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. with this preaching of the Goſpel to
<hi>Adam</hi> and to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, That I have formerly ſhewed, how the threatning of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was denounced in the hearing of fallen <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve;</hi> and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it implyed a ſtrong and a gracious promiſe to them: for from thence it muſt follow by neceſſary conſequence, that if the ſeed of the woman ſhould break the Devils head-plot, then they, and as many others as were elected, ſhould be redeemed from his power: and in this ſence it is, that the threatning which was denounced for the ruine of Sarans head-plot by the obedience of the ſeed of the woman in his ignominious death, was the preaching of the glad tidings of ſalvation to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But yet here it may be demanded, how, and after what manner all nations ſhould be bleſſed in the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and how, and after what manner in the ſeed of the woman.</p>
               <p>The anſwer is after one and the ſame manner, in them both alike, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the warlike combate and victory of the ſeed of the woman: in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the warlike enmity of the Devil and of all his porent ſeed, namely, by his conſonant obedience, even at the ſame time, when the Devil had a liberty of power to pierce him in the foot-ſoales, as a ſinfull malefactor on the Croſs: by which perfect obedience, he merited his Fathers recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, for the formal redemption of all believing ſinners from Satans head-plot, even then when Chriſt was made a curſe for us, in the outward manner of his death: And after this manner the believing ſinners of all
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:34410:166"/> Nations are bleſſed, firſt in the ſeed of the woman, and then alſo in the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> there is not one hairs breadth difference in the manner of performing theſe promiſes of bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From hence we may find out the true ſence of the Apoſtles reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13, 14. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, when</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>he was made a curſe for us: for it is written,</hi> (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Thou Satan ſhalt have a liberty of power to pierce him in the foote-ſoales, as a ſinfull male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor on the tree: and juſt ſo it is alſo written, in
<hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23.) <hi>Curſed is every one that hangs upon a tree.</hi> And from thence the Apoſtle doth make this bleſſed inference in
<hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>That the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (that promiſed ſeed of the woman, and alſo of <hi>Abraham,)</hi> for by his righteous performance of the ſaid combate in all his ſufferings, he got the victory: that ſo we might receive the promiſe of the ſpirit through faith, that is to ſay, through the preaching of this faith, and not by the bodily exerciſe of the works of the Law, as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 5. This Goſpel preached, is the only way and means that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to make good his promiſe of the ſpirit to the Elect of all Nations. And after this manner it is that Chriſt was ſent of God to bleſs us, that he might ſend the preaching of his Goſpel into all Nations, accompanied with the effectual operation of his ſpirit <hi>to turn us every one from our iniquities,</hi> Acts 3. 25, 26. <hi>To give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſinnes,</hi> Acts 5. 31. and ſo to work the grace of faith in this promiſed ſeed, that ſo we might be bleſſed with faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal 3. 9.</p>
               <p>And therefore, 2. It was by the preaching of this bleſſed Goſpel to our firſt parents, that God brought them to repentance, and to faith alſo: and ſo they had their ſins forgiven them, and were juſtified by performing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant of grace on their part, by believing in the righteous performance of the combate, by the ſaid promiſed ſeed of the woman: and they were bleſſed through the forgiveneſs of their ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1, 2. and ſo they were received into Gods ſpecial favour, as his children by adoption, <hi>Joh.</hi>
1. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I conclude therefore, that the bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in his ſeed Chriſt, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. muſt be expounded according to the firſt declaration, of the Covenant of grace and reconciliation made to <hi>Adam</hi> in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. for that is the very firſt foundation promiſe of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and it is no other but the ſame that was renewed unto
<hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and though it is now recorded unto us, but in very few words; yet it is evident, that it was opened unto
<hi>Abraham</hi> more at large, becauſe it is called the preaching of the Goſpel unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. and it is the ſelf-ſame Goſpel that was firſt preached to our firſt parents at large, though now we have but the brief heads of it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is the ſame promiſe of the Covenant of grace that was made alſo unto <hi>Iſaak</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 4. and alſo to <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 14. Theſe promiſes are recorded to us but in few words. But doubtleſs they were opened unto them abundantly more fully by the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>ſcepter</hi> I do not underſtand the whole Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> as many do, (though much amiſs,) becauſe the Hebrew word <hi>Shebet</hi> is often put for a Tribe, or for a Principality to be ruled; and ſo they put it here for the whole Tribe of <hi>Judah, that it ſhall not faile till Shiloh come.</hi> But I take this word for a ſcepter, as it is put for a ſign of regall Authority. The words then of this 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  <hi>verſe,</hi> muſt be thus underſtood, namely, That a right heir to ſway the ſcepter, ſhall not depart from the lineal deſcent of
<hi>Judah,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it come to Chriſt the right heir of <hi>Judah</hi> to ſway the ſcepter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor a Law-giver, [from between his feet.]</hi> This phraſe <hi>from between his feet,</hi> cannot be meant of the whole Tribe of
<hi>Judah,</hi> therefore it is not fit to tranſlate it a Tribe, but it muſt be taken for one that hath a legal right to give Laws, namely, for Chriſt the true Law-giver, whoſe right deſcent is from the loynes, or from between the feet of <hi>Judah,</hi> that is to ſay, from the place of begetting, and alſo from the place of birth: for the original ſignifies not only feet, but the whole legge and thigh. And in this reſpect the words muſt be expounded thus, <hi>[nor a Law-giver,] i.e.</hi> nor a right heir to give Laws, ſhall depart from between the feet of <hi>Judah,</hi> untill it come to Chriſt the laſt right heir of <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill Shiloh come:]</hi> That is, untill Chriſt the Son of <hi>Judah</hi> be born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> And for the full confirmation of this Expoſition, the holy Ghoſt hath recorded the Genealogy of Chriſt from <hi>Judah.</hi> 1. By his Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> (as it was ſuppoſed,) <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. And, 2. By his Mother <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 3. And from this double proof, we may ſee of what great uſe the ſaid Genealogies are, to prove the truth of this Propheſie, namely, that Chriſt was the right heir to <hi>Judah:</hi> both to ſway the ſcepter, and to give Laws, if Tirants had not kept his right from him: and indeed it was his good pleaſure to permit Tirants to keep his earthly Kingdom from him, that ſo his ſpiritual and mediatorial Kingdom here on earth, might be the better marked and regarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> in his laſt will, did give the right of the firſt-born to <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſaid, that his brethren ſhould confeſs him, meaning, that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the dignity of the firſt-born, in reſpect of the government to be given to him, and that Chriſt the King ſhould come of him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi>
7. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. And the other Tribes did acknowledge the dignity of this Tribe above the reſt, for this Tribe was the foremoſt of all in their marching through the wilderneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 14. and the Prince of this Tribe was the firſt that offered at the Dedication of the Altar,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 7. 11, 12. And after <hi>Joſiahs</hi> death, <hi>Judah</hi> was the firſt that went up to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:34410:167"/> fight for <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the
<hi>Canaanites,</hi> and got the victory, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. And the foremoſt in battle againſt their rebellious brethren, <hi>Judg.</hi>
20. 18. And the firſt Judge that ſaved <hi>Iſrael</hi> was of this houſe, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 3, 9. And God choſe this Tribe and <hi>David</hi> out of it, to ſettle the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his ſtock for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 68, 70, 71. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 20, 21, 28, 30, 36,
37. And to our Lord Jeſus, who came of <hi>Judah,</hi> doth the right of the ſcepter, and the right of making Laws belong, as <hi>Jacob</hi> declared it in his laſt will and teſtament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is alſo evident, that ſuch as have a true legal right to a temporal Kingdome, may be called Kings though they never come to Reign actually: as for example, the three heirs that <hi>Antiochus</hi> defeated of their actual right to Reign, are notwithſtanding called Kings by the holy Ghoſt, becauſe they had a true legal right to ſway the ſcepter, and to give Laws, <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. 8, 20, 24. But as I ſaid before, Jeſus Chriſt ſaw it neceſſary to ſuffer Tirants to take away his right to his temporal Kingdome, that ſo his ſpiritual and mediatorial Kingdome might be the better regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now there is no other right heir of the right line of
<hi>Judah,</hi> to ſway the ſcepter and to give Laws, but the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt: and this is alſo confirmed by <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 26, 27. for at the death of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of
<hi>Judah,</hi> was utterly perverted, <hi>untill be come</hi> (of
<hi>Nathan</hi> the ſonne of <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Judah,) whoſe right it is, and I will give it him.</hi> By this place of Scripture it is evident, that Chriſt had a true right to the temporal Kingdome, though he refuſed it, to the end his ſpiritual Kingdome might be the better taken notice of: and in that reſpect it was that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>My kingdome</hi> (emphatically ſo called) <hi>is not of this world: if my kingdome were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdome not from hence,</hi> Joh. 18. 36.</p>

               <p>This gathering of the peoples (of ſeveral Nations) unto
<hi>Shiloh,</hi> muſt be underſtood of their reſorting to him by faith through the preaching of the bleſſed Goſpel: that ſo they might fight the good fight of faith, under his banner, who is the onely Conqueror of Satans head-plot, by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience in his combate of ſufferings, from his envious Combater Satan and his potent ſeed. And this victory Chriſt doth hold forth like an eminent Enſign in the preaching of the Goſpel, which is lifted up to the elect of all Nations, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 10. where it is propheſied, <hi>That a root from Jeſſe ſhall ſtand up for an enſigne to the peoples,</hi> and <hi>to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek,</hi> (or reſort,) or be gathered together, and <hi>his reſt ſhall be glorious.</hi> And then in <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>He ſhall ſet up an enſign for the nations, and ſhall aſſemble the out-caſts of Iſrael, and gather together the disperſed of Judah, from the four corners of the earth.</hi> This enſign is nothing elſe but Chriſt crucified, and lifted up by preaching of the Goſpel, as in <hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>John</hi>

               <hi>The Meritorius price of Mans Redemption Deſcribed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingniſhed from the ſuppoſed Demeritorious cauſe of Chriſts Sufferings and Death, by Gods imputing of our ſinnes to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A Price in general, is any kind of thing that is given by one party and taken of another party by a mutual contract, for the purchaſing of
<note place="margin">A price in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſcribed.</note> any deſireable thing: and therefore that nothing in the world, though never ſo precious in it ſelf, can be truly called a price, for the purchaſing of any thing, untill it be made a price by a mutual contract: ſo then, the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a price is a mutual contract.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which is made a price by a mutual contract, may be ranked, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into ſuch things which are ſeperable from the buyers perſon, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or moveable goods are, or into ſuch things as cannot be ſeperated from the perſon of the buyer: as for example, when the taker will accept of nothing elſe, but of the perſonal ſervice of the purchaſer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This price of perſonal ſervice is alſo of a double conſideration: 1. It is either ſuch as may ſtand well with the ſafety of the purchaſers life, or elſe it is ſuch a perſonal ſervice, as doth neceſſarily put the purchaſers life in danger.</p>
            <p>In the firſt ſence <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Laban, I will ſerve thee ſeven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. And Laban conſented thereunto, and ſaid, It is better that I give her unto thee, than that I ſhould give her unto another man: abide with me. And Jacob ſerved for Rachel ſeven years, and they were in his eyes but a few dayes, becauſe he loved her. And</hi> (at the end of ſeven
<note place="margin">* <hi>The meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous price which is ſometimes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent thing, is the performance of ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous warlike, perſonal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>
               </note> years) <hi>Jacob ſaid unto Laban, give me my wife (for my dayes are fulfilled,) that I may go in to her,</hi> Gen. 29. 18, 19, 20, 21. But <hi>Jacob</hi> not having any dowry to give out of his ſubſtance, (as other men had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 12.
<hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 7.) doth out of his poverty give ſeven years ſervice to his Unkell, that ſo it might be accepted as the meritorious price for
<hi>Rachel</hi> to be his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 20. and thus, <hi>Iſrael ſerved for a wife, and for a wife kept ſheep,</hi> Hoſ. 12. 12.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond ſence, ſuch a perſonal ſervice is ſometimes required for he meritorious price of ſome eminent reward, as doth neceſſarily put the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:34410:169"/> life of the purchaſer into danger. And in this ſence it was that <hi>Caleb</hi> ſaid, <hi>He that ſmiteth Kiriah-Sepher and taketh it, to him will I give Achſah my daughter to wife: And Othniel the ſonne of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb took it: and be gave him Achſah his daughter to wife,</hi> Joſh. 15. 16, 17. with <hi>Judg.</hi> 1.
12, 13. From this inſtance you may ſee, that this perſonal ſervice which <hi>Othniel</hi> performed, was the meritorious price which he gave or performed for <hi>Calebs</hi> younger daughter to be his wife, and that it was ſuch a perſonal ſervice as did neceſſarily put his life in danger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When <hi>David</hi> heard that <hi>Goliah</hi> did challenge any ſingle perſon of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to combate with him for the victory: <hi>He ſaid to thoſe that ſtood by, what ſhall be done to the man that killeth this Philiſtim, and taketh away the reproach from Iſrael?</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 26. The people anſwered him three times over in
<hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 27, 30. <hi>The man that killeth him, the King will inrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his Fathers houſe free in Iſrael.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> accepted of this offer, and undertook to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſaid perſonal ſervice by a dangerous warlike combate. And then in <hi>verſ.</hi> 49. <hi>He put his hand in his bag, and took thence a ſtone and ſlang it, and ſmote the Philiſtim in his forehead, that the ſtone ſunk into his forehead, and then Goliah fell upon his face to the earth.</hi> And thus <hi>David</hi> prevailed over the Philiſtim with a ſling and a ſtone, and ſlew him. But <hi>Saul</hi> did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Covenant to <hi>David,</hi> but gave his elder daughter
<hi>Merab</hi> to another to wife: and not long after this, <hi>Jonathan</hi> pleaded with <hi>Saul</hi> for <hi>Davids</hi> life, ſaying, in 1
<hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>He put his life in his hand, and ſlew the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtim:</hi> and our Annotations ſaith, he expoſed his life to much danger, in undertaking a ſingle combate with ſuch a mighty Giant, from whom all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did flye at the firſt ſight of his approaching: this dangerous perſonal ſervice <hi>David</hi> performed as the meritorious price that
<hi>Sauls</hi> daughter might be his wife.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At another time <hi>Saul</hi> offered to give his daughter <hi>Michal</hi> unto <hi>David for a hundred foreskins of the Philistims,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 25. <hi>David</hi> accepted of this offer, and performed the condition of that contract on his part: for in <hi>verſ.</hi>
27. <hi>He brought unto David two hundred foreskins,</hi> inſtead of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>that he might be the Kings ſonne in Law: and then Saul gave him his daughter Michal to wife.</hi> This dangerous perſonal ſervice which
<hi>David</hi> performed, was the meritorious price which he performed or paid, for the obtaining of <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter <hi>Michal</hi> to wife: and therefore when <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> was kept from <hi>David, He ſent meſſengers to Mephiboſheth, ſaying, deliver me my wife Michal, which I purchaſed to me for a hundred foreskins of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.
14. <hi>David</hi> doth not plead that he purchaſed her for two hundred foreskins, though he paid two hundred, becauſe the contract was made but for a hundred, the other hundred was not purchaſed money, but a voluntary gift.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such a like dangerous warlike combate did <hi>Gideon</hi> perform with no more but three hundred men, againſt the numberleſs hoſt of the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites;</hi> as <hi>Jotham</hi> did plead his caſe with the
<hi>Sichemites,</hi> ſaying, in <hi>Jud.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>My father fought for you, and adventured his life farre, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian,</hi> that is to ſay, he undertook a long purſuit after the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:34410:169"/> flying enemy for the publick good. This dangerous warlike ſervice he performed as the meritorious price for his obtaining the place of Captain-General, which was alſo conferred on him by the after-contract of the people. And as ſoon as <hi>Peter Martry</hi> had expounded this victory of <hi>Gideon</hi> in <hi>Jud.</hi> 7. he doth conclude it thus in <hi>fol.</hi> 141.

But when <hi>Sampſon</hi> was thus mocked, he did by prayer ſo ſtir up his faith, that he did with the loſs of his own life, conquer the enemies of Gods Church more by his death, than he did by his life: and therefore this laſt act of his is brought in as the pattern of his ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 39. and thus through death he deſtroyed them that had the power of death over his body, as Chriſt alſo did in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
            <p>Theſe inſtances do in ſome ſort exemplifie the true nature of the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious price, which Chriſt performed or paid according to the will of God for mans redemption from Satans head-plot: for the declared will of God, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. was, that the ſecond perſon ſhould aſſume our true humane nature from the ſeed of the poor deceived captive woman; and that he ſhould in that nature venture his life in a warlike combate with his proclaimed enemy Satan, who had a liberty of power given him to provoke
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:34410:170"/> his paſſions to ſome ſinfull diſtemper or other, (if he could) by uſing him as the very worſt of all ſinfull malefactors: and yet God declared alſo, that this ſeed of the woman ſhould break the Devils head-plot, by his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous performance of the whole combate of his ſufferings, and his conſtant obedience was made manifeſt by his perfect patience under all his ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſufferings; and therefore his perfect obedience in his ſufferings, and in his death and ſacrifice, was accepted of God as the onely meritorious price and procuring cauſe of his reconciliation for mans redemption from Satans head-plot; for as ſoon as God is by this means reconciled to ſinners, he doth at the ſame time pardon their ſins, and receives their perſons into his ſpecial favour, and thus after this ſort, they are perfectly redeemed from Satans head-plot.</p>
            <p>In my former printed <hi>Reply,</hi> and alſo in my former Chapter of this Book, I have deſcribed the meritorious price of mans redemption, and have ſhewed that this price hath a double conſideration; 1. In Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And, 2. In his death and ſacrifice. 1. In his ſufferings, in that he did according to his eternal contract with his father, venture his life in a warlike combate with his proclaimed enemy Satan and his potent ſeed, according to the declaration of the combate in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.
15. which was of neceſſity to be done for his conſecration, or for the perfecting of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, before he could make his death to be accepted as a perfect ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And, 2. Then he did in that perfection of his obedience make his death a moſt pleaſing ſacrifice, by ſeparating his immortal ſoul from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by his own Prieſtly power, namely, by the actual power and joynt concurrence of both his natures. And this double performance is the full meritorious price for the procuring of Gods reconciliation for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believing ſinners: and no other combater in Heaven or in earth, was able to perform this meritorious price but himſelf alone; as I have ſhewed it in my former printed <hi>Reply</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 92, 145,

And yet I have alſo ſhewed, that it is quite contray to the order of vindicative juſtice, to admit of any ſureties for capital delinquents, either to perform their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of perſonal obedience, or to ſuffer their perſonal puniſhments, and therefore the Scripture is wholly ſilent in that way, and very clear for that way of merit which I have deſcribed.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That the wounds, bruiſes, and bloodſhed of ſuch as do win the prize

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3.

And in this ſence it is,

And the ancient Divines do bear witneſſe unto this truth, in that they do often ſay, that Chriſt conquered Satan by righteouſneſſe, namely, by his righteous performance of the great combate of his ſufferings, and in this reſpect it is that God doth ſtile him,

Satan and his ſeed had a liberty of power given them by Gods ſaid declaration, to uſe this ſeed of the woman as a ſinfull malefactor, <hi>bruiſing him in the heel,</hi> or as it is better rendred, by piercing him in the foot-ſoales on the Croſſe, out of a deſign, to provoke his paſſions to ſome ſinfull diſcontent or other; but becauſe this ſeed of the woman performed all his combate of ſufferings in perfection of patience and obedience, he conquered his envious comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by his righteous performance of the combate, for he became obedient to the death, even to the moſt painfull and ſhamefull death of the Croſſe.

               <p n="5">5. The reaſon of Chriſts dividing the ſpoil with his ſtrong enemy Satan is, becauſe he poured out his ſoul to death,

And, 4. In that reſpect it is that
<hi>Eſay</hi> in the next words ſaith, <hi>He was numbred with tranſgreſſors,</hi> or as the Hebrew word doth alſo ſignifie, he was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (to be a tranſgreſſor) among tranſgreſſors: but yet becauſe they could not by all this ill uſage ſpoile the perfection of his obedience to the Laws of the combate, God accepted of his ſufferings as of his conſecration and of his death, as of a moſt perfect and acceptable ſacrifice, and as of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious price of his reconciliation, for the redemption of all believers from Satans head-plot. And, 5. By his ſaid obedience in his combate of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerings and in his death and ſacrifice, he is ſaid <hi>to bear the ſinnes of the many,</hi> but how, not by taking their guilt upon him, as if God did impute to him the ſinnes of the elect, (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p n="16">16. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith thus in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9.
<hi>Jeſus was made a little</hi> (while) <hi>lower than the Angels, through his ſufferings of death;</hi> for in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. God had given a liberty of power to the Devil to pierce him in the foot-ſoales as a ſinfull malefactor, for a little while; but after he had ſuffered the worſt of the Devils malice for a little while, he was crowned with honour and glory as a righteous conquerour; for he conquered the Devil by his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous performance of the combate, and then in the perfection of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous performance, he actuated his death formally, as a moſt pleaſing and meritorious ſacrifice: for by that performance, he merited or procured his Fathers reconciliation for all believing ſinners. This was the true way and means, by the which Chriſt conquered Satan, and broke his head-plot in pieces, as touching the elect number: and from thence it follows in the next words,
<hi>That by the grace of God he ſhould taſte of death for every man,</hi> (that is to ſay, for every ſanctified man, as it is explained in
<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) Mark I pray, how the Apoſtle ſaith, that it came from the ſpecial grace of God to the humane nature of Chriſt, that he ſhould be advanced to ſuch an eminent office as to taſte of death, (namely, as a conquering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bater, from his old proclaimed enemy Satan and his potent ſeed,) that ſo it might become the meritorious price, or the procuring cauſe of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, for the redemption of every ſanctified man: and ſo in like ſort it was, from the ſpecial grace and favour of God to the aforenamed Captains in <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. that they were put upon ſuch an eminent ſervice as to venture their lives in ſeveral warlike combates, for the redemption of his Church from their oppreſſing enemies, as well as for their own advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

<q rend="margQuotes">"It was an act of Gods grace to Chriſt, in that he taſted of death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. and that the ſufferings of his humane nature, united unto the Divine Perſon of the Sonne of God, ſhould be accepted as a ranſome for us from eternal death. And he doth inferre from theſe words, That Chriſts death was not an act of pure juſtice, but an act of juſtice mixed with grace.</q> And I ſuppoſe I may truly adde thereto, that Chriſts taſting of death was not any act of Gods vindicative juſtice at all, but ſuch an act of juſtice, as the performance of a combate is, when it is performed according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a voluntary and mutual contract: and ſo conſequently it was an act of Gods ſpeical grace to advance the humane nature to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conquering combater that ever was; for it was Gods will that he ſhould conquer Satan and his potent ſeed by righteouſneſſe, namely, by his righteous performing of the great combate of his ſufferings; for it was Gods will, that by that performance, he ſhould merit his reconciliation for the redemption and juſtification of all believing ſinners, from the guilt of all their ſinnes.

               <p n="18">18.

               <p n="2">2. From this Text it is alſo evident, that God had given a liberty of

And, 2. The Devil had a power of liberty given him, to put him to death, or to pierce him in the foot-ſoales on the Croſſe, by which power the other two thieves were put to death for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, but Chriſt though he wanted not ſtrength of nature, yet he of his own accord died before them.</p>
               <p n="19">19.

               <p>But Mr <hi>Norton</hi> denies that Chriſt was tempted for tryal only: for ſaith he in <hi>pag.</hi> 80.
<q rend="margQuotes">"Though Chriſt was forſaken in way of tryal, yet not only, nor principally in a way of tryal: but his ſufferings (ſaith he) were proper puniſhments.</q> And but a few lines before he ſaid,

               </p>
               <p>By theſe and ſuch like aſſertions, he makes all the ſufferings of Chriſt to ariſe from the demeritorious cauſe of ſinne imputed to him, and thereby he doth utterly deſtroy the meritorious cauſe of Chriſts ſufferings, in as bad, or rather in a worſe manner than

                  <hi>Norton</hi> doth ſtretch the Greek word in theſe Scriptures, beyond the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:34410:177"/> true ſence and meaning of the context, (as he doth alſo in ſundry other Greek words) 2. I ſhewed before at
<hi>N.</hi> 20. that the Greek word in <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28. doth not in its firſt proper ſence ſignifie a price of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, but in a metaphorical ſence only. 2. The ſaid Greek word is uſed in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28. and in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 35. without any ſuch kind of ſatisfaction. 4. His ſecond Scripture cited from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. doth not mean ſuch a kind of ſatisfaction as he doth cite it for. I grant that <hi>Anti-Lutron</hi> is often uſed for a mutual redemption of one priſoner for another by way of exchange: but in that ſence Chriſt did not redeem ſinners, for then thoſe Priſoners that he redeems ſhould alſo redeem him by exchange. It follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this Greek word muſt not be taken in its moſt uſual ſence, but it muſt be taken in a more general ſence, to ſignifie any kind of thing that is given by a mutual contract, for the redemption of captives: ſo then, it is the mutual contract that doth make ſuch or ſuch a performance to be the full price of redemption; and of this ſee more in my former Book, <hi>p.</hi> 125, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. I grant, that Chriſt ſuffered a ſupernatural death in the formality of it, by his own prieſtly power, but not the ſecond ſupernatural death of his ſoul, under the eſſential torments of Hell, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Norton</hi> doth expound it. The Apoſtle affirmeth the contrary, namely, that Chriſt is the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Teſtament through death, for the redemption of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. and this death he doth compare to the death of a teſtator, which makes his Teſtament valid, namely, to a true bodily death, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. for where a teſtament is, there muſt of neceſſity be brought in the death of the Teſtator. The Apoſtle ſhould have made a wrong inference from this compariſon, in caſe no other death of Chriſt could have made the New Teſtament valid, but the death of his ſoul, under the ſence of Hell torments, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth aſſure us, That this Covenant-price is not made with corruptible things, as with ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb, without blemiſh and without ſpot; namely, by his unblemiſhed and ſpotleſſe performance of his warlike combate of ſufferings, from his envious combater Satan and his potent ſeed. The which righteous performance was accepted of God as the meritorious price or procuring cauſe of his attonement, for the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of all believing ſinners from the guilt of ſinne, and ſo conſequently from the curſe of the Law: and in which combate, God gave the Devil a liberty of power to put Chriſt to death, by piercing him in the foot-ſoales as a ſinnefull malefactor on the tree, to try if he could by any means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his paſſions to ſome ſinfull diſtemper or other; but becauſe he could not prevaile to provoke his paſſions to any ſinfull diſtemper, God accepted of the perfection of his obedience, both in his combate of ſufferings, and in his death and ſacrifice, as of the meritorious market-price, or as of the Covenant-counter price, for the procuring of his reconciliation for the redemption of all believing ſinners from the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 52. 2. And from thence it follows, that thoſe kind of means by the which they are delivered or redeemed, may be truely called the price of their redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>

               <p n="5">5.

And I find alſo that it is a Maxime in Law, that ſelf accuſation, or imputation of capital ſins to a mans ſelf, is no ſure ground for a legal Judge to inflict the puniſhment of death on ſuch a perſon, becauſe it doth ſometimes fall out, that ſuch as are weary of their lives, will impute capital ſins to themſelves, to the end they may be put to death.</p>

(In caſe ſuch ſureties were admitted, (which indeed are not admitted,) by the Laws of God, or by the Laws of any well-governed Common-weale,) and the reaſon thereof is, becauſe the Law it ſelf doth determine as well of the perſon, as of the thing due.</p>

And it is a received Maxime, both among the antient and many late Divines, that none can poſſible ſuffer the ſecond death, untill they be firſt guilty of the firſt ſpiritual ſin: and none elſe can be ſaid to be guilty of that firſt death in ſin, but the natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of fallen <hi>Adam</hi> onely. And, 2. None elſe can ſuffer the ſecond death of Hell torments, but ſuch only whoſe names are not found written in the Book of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14. And thence it follows, that either Chriſts
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:34410:185"/> name was not found written in the Book of life, or elſe that he did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the eſſential torments of Hell for our redemption.</p>

But (as I ſaid before,) the ſufferings of Chriſt are imputed to us in the nature of a meritorious cauſe properly ſo called, (and not in the nature of the demeritorious cauſe of ſin imputed to him,) namely, that God in conſideration of his perfect obedience in his combate of ſufferings to the death of the Groſſe, doth accept of his death ſo performed, as of a propitiatory ſacrifice for the procuring of his reconciliation, by the which all believing ſinners are redeemed and juſtified, from the condemning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all their ſins. And the internal ground of this ſatisfaction doth ariſe only from the conditions that were made between the Trinity in their eternal Covenant, wherein all the Trinity were equal Covenanters, and all the Articles of that Covenant were internal poſitive Laws, untill it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to declare them externally to our firſt fallen Parents in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. under a proclaimed combate of enmity, between one ſingle ſeed of the poor deceived woman, and the potent ſeed of the ſubtle Serpent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, wherein the righteous performer was to have the victory: and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of combaters, he only doth merit the prize that doth voluntarily undertake to perform the combate with his oppoſite Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in perfection of obedience to the Articles of thoſe voluntary Laws and

And by his ſingle death, he looſed both our deaths; and if he ſhould have ſuffered both, he could have delivered us from neither: but he mercifully undertooke one of them, and ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned both; he joyned his ſingle death to our double death, and dying, conquered both our deaths: he then which for us tooke upon him, onely the death of the body, ſuffered the ſhadow of death, and hid from Gods eyes the ſinne we had committed.</q> In this laſt expreſſion he makes the bodily death of Chriſt to be the proper meritorious or procuring cauſe of Gods reconciliation and forgiveneſſe, for nothing elſe can be ſaid to hide ſin from Gods eyes but his reconciliation ſo procured.</p>

               <p n="5">5. That common addition of fire, to ſignifie the wrath of God, by the which they think the death of Chriſt was made a ſacrifice, is no way ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the formality of Chriſts death and ſacrifice: for the formality of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice lies in this:
<list>
                     <item>1. That it muſt be put to death And,</item>
                     <item>2.
<note place="margin">The fire of the Altar that burned the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, was no type of the wrath of God, in making Chriſts death a ſacrifice.</note> That the blood thereof muſt be ſprinkled on the Altar by a conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prieſt. And,</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe typical actions doe teach us, (if we be not dull of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) that it doth not belong to the Father to be the Prieſt in Chriſts ſacrifice, neither to put him to death, nor to ſprinkle his blood, nor yet to be the Altar, nor his wrath to be the fire of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, but that all theſe typical actions doe belong unto Chriſt onely to fulfill them.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Taylor</hi> on Types, in the ſacrifice of
<hi>Noab,</hi> doth rightly make the God-head of Chriſt, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
14. to be typified by the fire of the Altar by the which his ſpotleſſe and unblemiſhed humane nature was offered a ſweet ſacrifice to God.</p>
               <p>I grant that before the blood was brought to the Prieſts at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>the Levites might kill the ſacrifice, and receive the blood in boules, &amp;c.</hi> as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23, 4, 28, 32. and 2
<hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 16. But as ſoon as theſe workes were done, the
<hi>Levites</hi> might goe no further, but onely bring the ſaid blood in boules to the Prieſts at the Altar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none elſe might ſprinkle the blood on the Altar, but the Prieſts onely, becauſe the act of ſprinkling was that moſt eſſentiall action that
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:34410:188"/> appertained to the ſacrifice, 1
<hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 49. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 21, 24. And ſaith
<hi>Maymony,</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">"The action of ſprinkling the blood upon the Altar is a weighty matter, it is the roote (or the principall) of the ſacrifice. See <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 45. and ſaith he in
<hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 5. The ſprinkling of the blood is a greater and a more peculiar Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly action than the killing of the ſacrifice is, it is a type of the continual interceſſion of Chriſt for us in heaven,

               </p>
               <p>And for the more ſtrict obſervation of theſe Rites, God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Prieſts to take the charge of the Alter, and of the holy place, and of the fire, and that no ſtranger (whether <hi>Iſraelite</hi> or

5, 7. For not long before this charge, Gods ſervent wrath fell upon
<hi>Korab,</hi> (and his company,) though he was a <hi>Levite,</hi> becauſe he preſumed to intermeddle in the Prieſts Office, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 10,
47.

               <p>From this diſcourſe from <hi>N.</hi> 5. I infer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God the Father could not put the fire of his wrath to Chriſts ſoul and body, to make it a ſacrifice of ſatisfaction to his juſtice for mans Redemption, becauſe it would have been a breach of his own conſtituted order, for he had ordained, that Chriſt ſhould be the only Prieſt, the onely Altar, and the onely fire of the Altar to make his bodily death a ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:34410:189"/> 2. From hence I do alſo inferre, that thoſe Writers who give the formality of ſatisfaction to his ſufferings from the fire of his Father wrath, doe thereby make the Father to be the Prieſt of Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and thereby they do confound the Prieſthood of the Father' (which hath no Prieſthood,) with the everlaſting Prieſthood of Chriſt, quite contrary to Gods own conſtituted order in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence I inferre, that ſeeing every typical Prieſt muſt have ſome commanded good thing to offer, as well for his own ſinnes, as the ſinnes of others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. that Chriſt having no ſinnes of his own, did offer himſelf for the ſinnes of the Elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.
3. and therefore he offered himſelf by his eternal Spirit without ſpot to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. He offered himſelf, 1. Before his death. And, 2. In his death. 1. Before his death he offered himſelf to performe that great warlike combate, with his proclaimed enemy Satan and his potent ſeed of Scribes and Phariſees, according to the declaration of the combate in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. where God gave unto the Devil a liberty of power to provoke the paſſions of Chriſt to ſome ſinnefull diſtemper or other, to ſpoile his obedience in his death and ſacrifice if he could. 2. But ſeeing the Devil could not by his ill uſage ſpoile the obedience of Chriſt, his ill uſage did but perfect his obedience, or conſecrate him to his Prieſtly ſacrifice: and then he offered himſelf in the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his death to God, as a propitiatory ſacrifice, even by his own Prieſtly power, namely, by the actual co-operation of both his natures, and by the fire of his own God-head, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. without any addition of that ſtrange fire of his Fathers wrath from the demeritorious cauſe of ſinne imputed.</p>

A plain evidence that all the Types of Holineſſe that were formerly appropriated to the Temple, to the holy City, to the holy Land, and to the holy National Church, were now ceaſed and Ended, becauſe the true Temple of Chriſts body was now by his miraculous death as it were rent in Twain; For as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith <hi>(Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Ariomanitas Hereſ.</hi> 69.) <hi>The Deity together wth the Soul did move to forſake the ſacred Body:</hi> and ſaith <hi>P.

It is evident that the death of Chriſt in the formality of it was miraculous: 1. By the Speech of the Centurion in <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 39. and 2. becauſe he did at an inſtant remove his Ghoſt from his Body, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 50. and 3. becauſe the Vail of the Temple (which typified his humane Nature) did at that inſtant rend in twain from the top to the bottom: intimating thereby, that the ſame power that rent the Vail in twain did ſeparate his Soul from his Body: By the which Prieſtly act of his he Ended all ſin and treſpaſſe Offerings and made Reconciliation for unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and brought in an Everlaſting Righteouſneſſe to all believers inſtead of the ceremonial Righteouſneſſe.</p>

<hi>School-Divinity,</hi> ſaith in <hi>p.</hi> 84, 85. The humane Nature doth inſiſt inſeparably in the perſon of the Son of God, even then when the fleſh was but in <hi>Fieri,</hi> a making, a conceiving, when it was but a rude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed lump of fleſh<hi>:</hi> then was this Hypoſtatical Union full: (And ſaith he in <hi>p.</hi> 98. In his Conception he was an

Saith he, at the death and diſſolution of the Humane Nature<hi>:</hi> even then when the parts of the humane Nature were ſeparated one from another: The Word did ſtill remain fleſh, then was this Union full<hi>:</hi> neither Soul nor Body were ſeparated from the ſecond Perſon of the Deity: and in
<hi>p.</hi> 85. he cites <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſpeaking ſweetly to this effect; and to this purpoſe I ſpeak (though briefly) in my <hi>Dialogue</hi> in
<hi>p.</hi> 11. But I find that ſome others do moſt erroneouſly affirm, that the Soul was infuſed in the ſame inſtant when the Word aſſumed fleſh: and thence it followes, that he at the firſt aſſumed the perſon of a man; and ſecondly, thence it will alſo follow that the Mediator ſhould be two diſtinct perſons, as <hi>Neſtorius</hi> held<hi>:</hi> But ſeeing it is granted by all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, that the union with his fleſh was not diſſolved when his Soul was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from his Body by death, I ſee not what ſhould hinder but that he might unite his fleſh to his divine perſon before his Soul was infuſed: and this order of his Union will prevent the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> errour of aſſuming the perſon of a man in his Conception; and Mr. <hi>Trap</hi> doth fall into that errour in his <hi>Annot.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 3. For he doth there affirm that Chriſts Soul was created in, and with his Body in the Virgins Womb the ſelf-ſame moment: But Dr. <hi>Uſher</hi> in his <hi>Sum of Divinity,</hi> doth in <hi>p.</hi> 165. propound this Queſtion: <hi>What was the cauſe that the perſon of the Son of God did not joyn it ſelf to a perfect perſon of man?</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is threefold<hi>:</hi> 1. Becauſe there would not then be a perſonal union of both to make one perfect Mediator. 2. Becauſe then there ſhould be four perſons in Trinity. 3. Becauſe the works of each of the Natures, could not be accounted the works of the whole perſon: whereas now by the union of both Natures in one perſon, the obedience of Chriſt performed: in the manhood is become of infinite merit, as being the obedience of God who purchaſed his Church with his own blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If Grace was in him out of meaſure by vertue of perſonal union in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, then it cannot be true which is affirmed by the holy Ghoſt, that he did <hi>afterwards grow in Grace,</hi> Luke 2. 40,
52.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If Grace was in him out of meaſure by vertue of perſonal union, then he needed not any new anoynting by the holy Ghoſt into the execution of his Mediators Office, becauſe no more could be added to that Grace in caſe it was in him out of meaſure by vertue of his firſt perſonal union in the Womb.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If Grace was in him out of meaſure by vertue of perſonal union in the Womb, it will from thence follow that he aſſumed his humane to be as a true part of his divine Perſon, as our Souls are with our Bodies: But this may not be granted; for then his divine Nature muſt of neceſſity have endowed his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature with the proportion of the Divine, and then his humane Nature could not have ſuffered nor dyed for our Redemption. But I have ſhewed in my former printed <hi>Reply,</hi> That Chriſts humane Nature was no true part of his divine Perſon, but an Adjunct or an Appendix only: and therefore his divine Nature did not neceſſarily endow it with the properties of the divine; nor yet
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:34410:199"/> with all Graces out of meaſure by vertue of perſonal union in his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I do notwithſtanding freely grant that this humane Nature was well prepared for action by vertue of his Conception by the holy Ghoſt, becauſe it was an act that did conſtitute the perſon to the Office of Mediatorſhip when he ſhould be called extrinſecally thereunto; for by vertue of that divine Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his humane Nature was framed after Gods Image in moral perfections as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was in his firſt creation<hi>:</hi> But theſe moral perfections of his Nature muſt be differenced from his extrinſecal and ſupernatural Anoyntings by the holy Ghoſt at his Baptiſm, becauſe the holy Ghoſt doth work as well in the Creation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles (as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. with
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 104. 30.) as in the Creation of ſupernatural Principles: and I think nothing is more clear and evident then this, Namely, that neither the perſon of the Word nor of the holy Ghoſt did furniſh Chriſt in his conception with ſupernatural Graces out of meaſure for the full execution of his Office, becauſe he received further degrees of Grace as he grew in Years as I noted it above, and becauſe he was not extrineſecally anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the execution of that Office with Graces out of meaſure untill the holy Ghoſt ſat upon him at his Baptiſm.</p>

               </p>
               <p>VVAs when Chriſt was extrinſecally anoynted by the holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mediators office at his Baptiſm when he began to be thirty years of age; this was the time appointed of the Father for that purpoſe: and therefore at this time Chriſt went on purpoſe to <hi>Jordan</hi> to be baptized of <hi>John</hi> in the publick view of <hi>Johns</hi> Auditory, and then the Spirit of God deſcended like a <hi>Dove</hi> and ſat upon him, and then a voyce came from the Father out of Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3. 16, 17. with
<hi>Luke</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt was no ſooner anoynted Extrinſecally into the Mediators Office, but he was preſently led by the earneſt zeal of that Spirit too, into the Wilderneſſe on purpoſe to try maſteries with his proclaimed enemy the Devil, who had a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of power given him from this time forth to tempt him to ſome ſin or other: and he continued to tempt him for forty dayes together, and then at the end of thoſe forty dayes he had a liberty of power given him to tempt Chriſt with three notable Temptations in three places of advantage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is obſerved that Chriſt was ſo anoynted with all the Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out of meaſure that he conquered the Devil in all his Temptations: (for it is ſaid, <hi>that the Devil left him for a ſeaſon,</hi> Luke 4. 13.) then Chriſt remained in the Field as the moſt abſolute Conqueror. And 2. <hi>Then the Angels came and</hi>

                  <hi>miniſtred unto him.</hi> And 3. Then he return'd preſently by the power of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into
<hi>Galile;</hi> and he came firſt to the City <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and as his cuſtom was, he went into the <hi>Synagogue</hi> on the Sabbath-day, and he found the place where it is written, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anoynted me to preach the Gospel to the poor,</hi> Luke 4.
18.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is much to be obſerved, how he doth from this Text (cited from <hi>Eſay</hi>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:34410:200"/> 61. 1.) cals the Graces of the Spirit which he had now received at his Baptiſme, his Anoyntings. And 2. at this inſtant there was a man preſent that had a ſpirit of an unclean Devil, which cryed out and ſaid, <hi>I know who thou art, the holy one of God,</hi> Luke 4. 34. but before this the Devil did not call him the holy One of God; but now he doth not call him the holy One of God, becauſe he had been newly anoynted at his Baptiſm with Office Graces, before this he was not ſeparated from his former Trade of Life; but now by his extrinſecal anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Mediators Office he was ſeparated from his former Trade of Life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Take ſpecial notice alſo that <hi>Peter</hi> doth call the gift of the holy Ghoſt which Chriſt received at his Baptiſm
<hi>[his Anoynting]</hi> Emphatically. <hi>The word</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you know began to be publiſhed from</hi> Galile<hi>: After the Baptiſm which</hi> John <hi>preached, how God Anoynted Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth,
<hi>with the holy Ghoſt and with Power:</hi> From theſe words take ſpecial notice,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Peter</hi> doth limit the time of Chriſts Extrinſecal Anoynting to his Mediators Office: To begin (not at his perſonal union at his Incarnation and Conception by the holy Ghoſt: But) after the Baptiſm which <hi>John</hi> preached, for <hi>John</hi> had preached the Baptiſm of Repentance about five or ſix months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt came to be baptized of him: and doubtleſſe Chriſt did purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his coming untill the time that he began to be about thirty years of age, in relation to the time that the <hi>Levites</hi> did enter into their Office; for though they had a perſonal Right to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle by birth, yet they might not enter into the full execution of the Office untill they began to be thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of age, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4 7. See
<hi>Ainſworth</hi> there, <hi>John the Baptiſt (A Levite)</hi> began alſo his Miniſtry at that Age<hi>:</hi> And Chriſt (fulfilling all Figures) at that age was anoynted at his Baptiſm, began the preaching of the Goſpel,
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35, 36. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 2, 3, 23. And ſo though Chriſt was by birth the perſon that ſhould extrinſecally execute the Office of the Mediator; yet he did not glorifie himſelf to do the Office of a Mediator extrinſecally at his Birth: but at the firſt he led a private Life untill the time that his Father ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> Heb 5. 5. or raiſed thee up unto the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal execution of thy Prieſtly Office. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaking of the right manner of Electing Biſhops, ſaith in his <hi>Chriſtian-Offices,</hi> B.
1. <hi>p.</hi> 129. That God himſelf choſe <hi>Aaron,</hi> that no humane deſire might bear ſway in that choyſe, but the grace of God: not a voluntary offer, nor a proper and private Aſſumption or Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but a Heavenly, lawfull and publick Calling: as it is written, <hi>no man taketh this honour upon him, but he that is called of God, as was</hi> Aaron: Thus far he,
<hi>Aaron</hi> was called by Name to the Prieſtly Office, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.
1. and this is applyed to Chriſt in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 5, 6. And as ſoon as the Prieſts were extrinſecally conſecrated to that Office they began to offer Sacrifices, and to make Atonement for all <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So</p>
               <p>Chriſt was begotten or raiſed up at two ſeveral times after two ſeveral manners<hi>:</hi> as it is expreſſed in <hi>Acts</hi>
13.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid thus in <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>God according to his promiſe hath raiſed up to</hi> Iſrael <hi>a Saviour Jeſus.</hi> Now the punctual time when God did raiſe him up is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

<hi>v.</hi> 24. Namely, it was when <hi>John</hi> had firſt preached before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Baptiſme of Repentance to all the people of

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:34410:200"/> juſt at the ſame time as I expreſſed it before from <hi>Peters</hi> words in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 37.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt time wherein God raiſed up Chriſt to his extrinſecal executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Mediators Office<hi>:</hi> and this raiſing up is further proved in <hi>v.</hi> 33. by this teſtimony of Scripture,
<hi>This Day have I begotten thee:</hi> and from hence it follows that theſe two phraſes, <hi>Gods raiſing,</hi> and <hi>Gods beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Day of Chriſts anoynting to the Mediators Office when he began to be thirty years of Age, is the Day of Gods raiſing him up to that Office, or it is the day wherein God hath begotten him to the extrinſecal execution of that Office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of Gods raiſing up of Chriſt, is his raiſing him up from

And this is called <hi>his raiſing up from the dead</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 30. but the Apoſtle doth not call the former raiſing, his raiſing up from the dead; But as Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> doth rightly obſerve in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>this day have I begotten th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. It is alſo obſervable that in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 33. the Apoſtle doth uſe the ſame Greek word for the Mediators extrinſecal raiſing up or begetting to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Mediators Office that is uſed in the ſame ſence in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 5 <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. The Scripture doth often mention this extrinſecal begetting or raiſing up of Chriſt to the extrinſecal execution of his Mediators Office, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 15, 18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 5.
<hi>Luke.</hi> 1. 69. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 30. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 26.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This raiſing up or begetting of Chriſt into his Mediators Office is called <hi>his Anoynting</hi> by the holy Spirit in
<hi>Eſay</hi> 61. 1. And Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in his <hi>Annot.</hi> on
<hi>Eſay</hi> 11. 2. ſaith, The Spirit of the Lord did not come upon him only, as it did upon his Mother in the conceiving of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35. But it did Reſt and Abide with him, and take up in a more ſpecial, yea ſingular manner its perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and never interrupted or eclipſed Reſidence with him, and in him: and this, ſaith he, was typified by the holy Ghoſts deſcending in the likeneſſe of a <hi>Dove</hi> at his Baptiſm, and reſting upon him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 16. And ſaith he a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Prophet goes on to recite ſome Heads of thoſe particular Endowments, wherewith the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in his own Nature ſhould be ſuperabundantly furniſhed above all Creatures, Men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. Another eminent Divine ſaith thus: The Prophets did not alwayes ſpeak by the inſtinct of the holy Spirit, but ſometimes they were deſtitute of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: But the Son of God becoming man had this prerogative only, he had the Spirit of God alwayes remaining or abiding in him,
<hi>John</hi> 1. 32, 33. <hi>Upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending and abiding upon him, the ſame is he that Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mark theſe words: <hi>remaining and abiding upon him;</hi> for by this fulneſſe of the Spirit he is diſtinguiſhed from all other men whatſoever<hi>:</hi> for though the Spirit deſcending upon others, yet it did not remain and abide upon them as it did upon Chriſt; as it is alſo obſerved before by Mr.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:34410:201"/> 
                  <hi>Gataker</hi> at N. 5. And therefore when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>My God, my God why hast thou forſaken me,</hi> the inward ſupplyes of the Spirit were not Eclipſed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth fully accord to this fulneſſe of the Spirit wherewith Chriſt was extrinſecally anoynted to the execution of his Mediators Office: as I find it cited at large in
<hi>Bullengers Decades, p.</hi> 729.</p>
               <p>Concluſion from the Premiſes.</p>
               <p>From the ſaid Remarkable obſervations it follows, that though Chriſt in his Conception and Birth was created after God Image in moral perfections: yet before he could extrinſecally execute the Office of a Mediator he ſtood in need of a ſupernatural Unction, of all the Graces of the holy Spirit to remain and abide upon him for the better performance of his Mediatorial obedience in his Combat of ſufferings untill he had performed the ſame as a ſweet-ſmelling Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God for the procuring of his Fathers Reconciliation to all believing ſinners for their full Redemption from <hi>Sathans</hi> head-plot.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Mr. Norton</hi> doth run in a contrary ſtrain, for he ſaith in <hi>p.</hi> 239. <hi>That there was more habitual Grace in Christ then there is duty in the Law, becauſe Chriſt was Godman, and received the Spirit out of meaſure.</hi>

<hi>Chriſts</hi> humane Nature were created: Or 2. Into the Law of the Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation; for it is manifeſt by the ſecond Commandement, that God in Trinity (and in ſpecial Chriſt as Mediator) doth promiſe to do mercy unto Thouſands (of the fallen ſons of <hi>Adam)</hi> that do love him and keep his Commandements<hi>:</hi> and from thence it follows, that this ſhewing of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth require as much duty from Chriſt as Mediator, as ſhould abound to the Redemption, Juſtification and Salvation of all the Thouſands of Repenting and Believing ſinners that ſhall be ſaved. And 3. The word <hi>Law,</hi> may be taken for that peculiar Law of the Eternal Covenant, wherein Chriſt had obliged himſelf to do the whole Office of the Mediator.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſence, there was no more habitual Grace in Chriſts humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then there is duty in the moral Law of Nature, or elſe God ſhould not have given a perfect Rule of the moral duty to Chriſts humane Nature. And this Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> himſelf doth affirm but three lines before, Namely, That Chriſts Original Righteouſneſſe is that gracious inherent diſpoſition of his, from the firſt inſtant of his Conception, whereby he was habitually conformable to the Law, Namely to the moral Law of Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:34410:201"/> 2. There was not, as I conceive any more habitual Grace in Chriſt then there was that ſpecial Law of Mediatorſhip, for that Law did require him to be anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted extrinſecally with the Spirit out of meaſure, even above all his Fellows, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. 7. for the compleat fulfilling of his Mediators Office, as I have at large ſhewed before; and therefore according to this Law it may be ſaid, there was more acquired grace in Chriſt then there was duty in the moral Law of Nature, but not more habitual Grace.</p>

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:34410:203"/> the Form of a man, which is nothing elſe but the receiving of an old ſtale Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour<hi>:</hi> For <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his third Book of <hi>Chriſtian-Offices,</hi> ſaith in <hi>p.</hi> 3. Chriſt the Lord when he was in the Form of God made himſelf of no Reputation that he might take upon him the Form of a Man: He puts the Form of Man inſtead of the Form of a Servant: But by comparing of Scriptures together: I have ſhewed that <hi>the Form of a ſervant</hi> is a Name of Office, Namely of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Office, and not the natural property of his humane Nature: and in that reſpect I ſay, That the time when he did firſt begin to take upon him <hi>the form of a ſervant,</hi> was at the ſame time when he did firſt begin to take upon him the Extrinſecal Office of the Mediator, Namely when he was extrinſecally anointed to that Office at his Baptiſm, which was when he began to be thirty years of age: as I have alſo explained in <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. at <hi>N.</hi> 2. and alſo in my former Book.</p>

               <p>The wicked <hi>Jews</hi> are often ſaid <hi>to lay wait for Christ to take him and to kill him,</hi> a good ſpace of time before the expiration of the <hi>Seventy-ſeven</hi> years, as in <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 18.

9. 2.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, His prayer was made more particularly at the time of the <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                  <hi>Oblation,</hi> Dan. 9. 21.</p>
               <p>From theſe three marks of time, the <hi>Seventy-ſevens of years</hi> muſt exactly have their Beginning. And 2. They muſt have their full End at the death of Chriſt exactly to the hour of the <hi>Evening Oblation,</hi> Mat. 27. 46. Mar. 15. 34.</p>
               <p>This Beginning and Ending of the <hi>Seventy-ſevens of years</hi> is very often inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> not only in his <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in his <hi>Concent of Scripture,</hi> but alſo in divers others of his Books wherein he doth purpoſely diſpute this point: The word however being taken for the <hi>Jewes</hi> large hour of Sacrificing, which comprehendeth under it three of our ſmall hours, as I have explained it more at large in my <hi>Treatiſe of holy Time.</hi> And from thence I infer, That the <hi>Seventy-ſevens</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. are an exact Chronology of time, from the time of his Prayer to the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The certainty of this time is further demonſtrated by the Angels words to <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>I am now come forth to give thee skill and underſtanding,</hi> Namely, of the particular point of time when the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould finiſh Treſpaſſe and end Sin-offerings, which point of time thou kneweſt not before: but yet
<hi>Daniel</hi> knew before the Angel came to him, that all the Elect ſhould be Redeemed from all their unrighteouſneſſe by the death of Chriſt, but he knew not the exact time when it ſhould be wrought by the death of Chriſt: therefore the Angel was now ſent unto him to give him that Skil and underſtanding of the particular point of time when it ſhould be accompl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſhed, of which point of time
<hi>Daniel</hi> was wholly ignorant until the Angel came to inſtruct him in it: and therefore the Angel did ſtir up his attention, ſaying in
<hi>v.</hi> 22, 23, 24. <hi>I am come to give thee skill and underſtanding, therefore underſtand the matter, and conſider the Viſion, that</hi> Seventy ſevens <hi>of years are exactly accounted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in caſe the Angel had given him a certain time for an uncertain, as ſome Interpreters do moſt unadviſedly affirm: then the Angels ſaid doubled exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to underſtand the matter and to conſider the Viſion, that the ſaid <hi>Seventy-ſevens of years were most exactly accounted,</hi> had been no better then a meer diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and deceit: For from thence it will follow, that the Angel was not ſent as he ſaid he was in <hi>v.</hi> 22. to give him skil and underſtanding, ſeeing he made him to underſtand no more then he knew before; For he knew before that Chriſt
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:34410:207"/> ſhould by his death make Reconciliation for unrighteouſneſſe, but he was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the point of time when he ſhould do it by his death; and then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſhould have been the groſſeſt deceiver that ever ſpake (as Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi> doth ſpeak.) But <hi>Daniel</hi> doth acknowledge in <hi>v</hi> 22. That the Angel did inform him of ſome particular thing that he knew not before: and that particular can be nothing elſe but the informing of him of the particular point of time of Chriſts death; Therefore that point of time was it, for the which God ſent his Angel to give Skil and Underſtanding unto
<hi>Daniel.</hi>

                     <p>A Teſtament is not confirmed, but by the death of the Teſtator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17. Thence it follows, that the Death of Chriſt is here ſignified to be effected at the juſt end of Seventy-ſevens of years, for the confirming of the ſaid Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>The Typical Teſtament was only confirmed by the death of beaſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 7, 8. But thoſe beaſts were not Teſtators, and therefore the blood of thoſe heaſts had not the virtue of Confirmation by any natural right, but by Gods poſitive Covenant only<hi>:</hi> It was Gods poſitive Covenant only that made the blood of Bulls and Goats to be the Confirmation of the Typical Covenant, to the purifying or juſtifying of the Bodies of the National Church from their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial ſins; and in that reſpect, God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſprinkle that blood, both upon the Book of the Teſtamental Covenant, and alſo upon the people (in their Repreſentatives) for every Tribe had their Repreſentative at the confirming of the ſaid Teſtamental Covenant. In like ſort, the Death of Chriſt had its Meritorious Efficacy from the conditions that were agreed on in the Eternal Covenant betwixt the Trinity, for the Confirmation of all the Bleſſings of the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.
20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26, 27, 28. which Teſtament contrives theſe two general Heads. 1. A new heart. 2. Pardon of ſin. And in this laſt reſpect it is ſaid, that the Blood of Chriſt hath virtue to purge the Conſcience from the dead works of moral ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> on the Covenant ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 196.

                     <p n="2">2. Hence it follows, that the way of juſtifying the Bodies of the National Church from their ceremonial ſins, by the typical works of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was to laſt no longer then till the New Teſtament was confirmed by the Death of Chriſt; and that the New Teſtament after that, was to continue without any alteration to the end of the world, and in that reſpect it is called the Everlaſting Teſtament,

<hi>Iſrael,</hi> was becauſe it was ordained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Gods Atonement, or his Reconciled Forgiveneſſe for the uncleanneſſes which the Altar had received from the ſins and treſpaſſes of the ſons of
<hi>Iſrael:</hi> and from thence it follows, that Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe procured by the blood of the ſin-Offering, did cleanſe and ſanctifie, <hi>i.e.</hi> did juſtifie the Altar
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:34410:219"/> from the uncleanneſs of the ſons of

Whereas it is ſometimes ſaid, that Gods attonement doth cleanſe them from all their ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; and ſometimes, that their Sacrifices doth cleanſe them; the meaning is, that Sacrifices did cleanſe them, as they were ordained to be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious or procuring cauſe of Gods attonement.

<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9, 10. And ſaith Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9.

                     <hi>God made the death of Chriſt to be a ſacrifice of righteouſneſſe,</hi> 1. <hi>in relation to his righteous performance; and</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe it procured Gods atoned forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect justification of believing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the guilt of ſin,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. I have ſhewed in my former <hi>Reply,</hi> That Gods atonement is procured by the Sacrifice of Righteouſneſſe: Namely, by Chriſts Righteous performance of his Combat of ſufferings, and of his death and Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have alſo ſhewed, that Gods atoned Forgiveneſſe procured thereby, is a Believing ſinners perfect Righteouſneſſe, or his perfect juſtification from the guilt of ſin<hi>:</hi> and that Chriſts active Righteouſneſſe to the moral Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not meritorious, becauſe it is meerly natural, and therefore God made no Covenant for it. And therefore 2. God doth not impute it to ſinners, neither as a meritorious cauſe, nor yet as the matter of their Righteouſneſſe: It is ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>Christ is made unto us of God, Righteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. but that is not to be underſtood of the material Cauſe, but only of the meritorious Cauſe of our Righteouſneſſe, or of our juſtification from ſin; and to that ſence doth the confeſſion of <hi>Saxony</hi> expound it in the
<hi>Article of Remiſſion of ſins and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> Chriſt (ſaith that Confeſſion) is our Righteouſneſſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> ſay, becauſe that by his merit we have Remiſſion<hi>:</hi> ſo that in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Chriſt is our Righteouſneſſe no otherwiſe, but as he is the meritorious Cauſe of Gods Reconciled Remiſſion. And 2. Thence it follows, that in their
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:34410:225"/> judgement, Gods Remiſſion is the formal cauſe of a believing ſinners juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the typical pattern of a ſinners juſtification: The Leper that was juſtified from his ceremonial ſins of uncleanneſſe, was juſtified therefrom by two birds, whereof the one was ſlain, and the other, after it was firſt dipped in the blood of
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. <hi>to ver.</hi> 20, 49, 52,
53.</note> the ſlain bird, was let go alive. Theſe two birds did typifie the Death and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 1. to
<hi>v.</hi> 20. and in <hi>v.</hi> 49. they were ordained to be the procuring cauſe of Gods atonement for the full cleanſing both of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and alſo of the leprous Houſe from their ceremonial ſins: and upon their performance of theſe typical works of the Law, God annexed this promiſe, that <hi>they ſhall be clean,</hi> Namely, fully juſtified from their ceremonial ſins by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement that was procured thereby; as in
<hi>v.</hi> 8. with <hi>v.</hi> 52, 53. And the like promiſe of perfect cleanneſſe by Gods atonement, is made to the Leper in <hi>v.</hi> 20. and from this typical pattern of juſtification which is our School-maſter to Chriſt; we may ſee how we are juſtified in the typified ſence from our moral ſins, namely, by the blood of Chriſt, as it is the procuring cauſe of of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Forgiveneſſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> makes Atonement to comprehend under it, both the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and Formal cauſe of a ſinners juſtification: his words in <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 18. run

                  </note> thus; The Sin-Offering in

<hi>from among the Children of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>and cleanſe them: and thus ſhalt thou do unto them to cleanſe them, ſprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them ſhave all their fleſh, and let them waſh their cloathes and make themſelves clean,</hi> (or as the <hi>Seventy</hi> render it, <hi>let them make themſelves purified)</hi> and then it is ſaid, in
<hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>The</hi> Levites <hi>purified themſelves,</hi> or made themſelves ſinleſſe: they did that which was required to be done on their part for the making of themſelves ſinleſſe: (and this legal act of theirs doth typifie, that our moral ſins muſt be waſhed away on the ſinners part by true Repentance, and by Faith in Chriſts Expiatory Sacrifice, as it is the only procuring cauſe of Gods atonement for their full juſtification from the guilt of ſin.) And then <hi>Aaron</hi> offered them as an Offering before the Lord and <hi>made an atonement for them to cleanſe them.</hi> And from hence it follows, that Gods atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the full and formal cauſe of a ſinners juſtification from ſin. 3. It is alſo to be marked, that this ſprinkling of the <hi>Levites</hi> with the purifying water, was the final Right of their cleanſing: and from thence it follows by an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable conſequence, that Gods Atonement for the ſake of Chriſts meritorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in his Death and Sacrifice, doth fully or formally cleanſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> juſtifie the Souls of believing ſinners from the guilt of all their moral ſins: and to this very ſence doth our

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:34410:231"/> this waſhing; Namely, as it doth make Believing Sinners to be whiter then ſnow: For <hi>David</hi> doth in theſe words, compare the cleanneſſe that Sinners do receive from Gods atoned Forgiveneſſe to the whiteneſſe of ſnow<hi>:</hi> yea, he doth prefer it in the ſuperlative degree to be whiter then any ſnow, and yet in mans eye there is nothing that is whiter then the ſnow in <hi>Salmon,</hi> Pſalm
68. 14. But <hi>David</hi> doth affirm, that Gods atonement procured by the Sacrifice of Chriſt, doth make Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sinners to be whiter in his ſight, then any ſnow can be in our ſight: and conſequently, that his ſaid atonement, doth make them to be whiter in his ſight then <hi>Adam</hi> was in his Innocency; For that concreated moral Righteouſneſſe, wherewith he did adorn <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt Creation, was but Natural R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and therefore it belonged but to his comfortable Natural life, in the ſweeter contents of an earthly Paradiſe only: And therefore 2. It could never have advanced him to the Heavenly Inheritance; But now by the Covenant of Gods ſupernatural Grace and Reconciliation God doth make Believing Sinners to be ſupernaturally whiter in his ſight then any ſnow can be in our ſight, becauſe he doth by his ſaid atoned Forgiveneſſe, not only make them Sinleſſe from the guilt of all their moral ſins, but doth thereby receive them alſo unto the adoption of the Heavenly Inheritance; and ſo by this ſupernatural means, God doth make them whiter in his ſight then
<hi>Adam</hi> was in his natural and innocent condition, in caſe he had been confirmed in that natural Righteouſneſſe by his Covenant; eating of the Tree of Life in the firſt place. But Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth not diſtinguiſh this ſupernatural Righteouſneſſe from <hi>Adams</hi> natural Righteouſneſſe: he makes no other Righteouſneſſe for the juſtification of believing ſinners, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Reconciliation:</hi> 1. In the meritorious, and 2. in the formal cauſe.</p>
            <p n="19">19. It is ſaid in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27. That Chriſt gave himſelf for his Church, that he might ſanctifie it and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the Word, and that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This expreſſion, <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for his Church:</hi> meaneth, that he put his life in his hand when he undertook that great Combat of his ſufferings from his old proclaimed enemy, <hi>Sathan</hi> and his potent ſeed, according to the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Combat in

4. and becauſe it was ſo performed, God did accept it as the only meritorious cauſe of his atonement to all his Elected militant Church of believing ſinners: by which means they are made perfectly holy and righteous from the guilt of ſin, and thereupon Chriſt doth preſent them to himſelf as a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle or any guilt of ſin, but are holy and without blemiſh<hi>:</hi> and in this ſence Chriſt ſaith thus to his Elected Church, in <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Thou art all fair my love,</hi> there is no blemiſh in thee<hi>:</hi> and in this ſence it is alſo ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1, 5. that the 144 Thouſand, that ſtood with the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh before the Throne of God<hi>:</hi> But all this perfection of their unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhedneſſe, doth come fully and formally from Gods atoned Forgiveneſs through the meritorious procuring cauſe of Chriſts obedience in his Death and Sacrifice.

<pb n="461" facs="tcp:34410:235"/> doth require them to be for their attainment of the Heavenly Inheritance; and therefore this ſupernatural kind of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe by Gods atoned Forgiveneſſe, is to be preferred far above that Natural holineſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was created: for that Natural holineſſe and righteouſneſſe ſhould never have brought <hi>Adam</hi> (and his Natural poſterity) to the Heavenly Paradiſe, as the foreſaid ſupernatural holineſſe and righteouſneſſe doth to all believing ſinners, as I noted it in <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. to the utter conviction of Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> kind of Juſtification by <hi>Adams</hi> Natural Holineſſe performed by Chriſt, and imputed by God (as he ſurmiſeth) to all Believers.</p>

1. You are waſhed from your ſins fully and formally by Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe (as I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly opened the Metaphor) 2. You are ſanctified or made holy from ſin by Gods ſaid Reconciled Forgiveneſſe (as I have alſo abundantly opened this Metaphor) 3. You are juſtified from ſin by Gods ſaid Reconciled Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and to this ſence doth
<hi>P. Martyr</hi> expound theſe three terms in this Text, and alſo in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 6, 7. and to this very ſence doth the Apoſtle expound the word <hi>ſanctified,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath ſent me to the</hi> Gentiles <hi>to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light.</hi> 1. For the working out of their inherent Sanctity. And 2. That they might receive the forgiveneſſe of their ſins (for their formal juſtification) and inheritance among them that are ſanctified (from ſin) by Faith in me. Hence it follows, that Gods Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth not only deliver from Hell, but alſo that it gives a Right to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance, among them that are ſanctified from ſin by Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe.</p>

By which Will of God (performed by Chriſt in his Combat of ſufferings, &amp; in his death and ſacrifice) we are ſanctified, that is to ſay, juſtified, or made holy from ſin: for it was the will of God, that in caſe Chriſt did perform his ſaid combat of ſuffering and his death and ſacrifice, in perfection of Obedience, that it ſhould be accepted of him as the meritorious procuring cauſe of his Reconciled Forgiveneſſe, for the full and formal ſanctification of believing ſinners from the guilt of ſin.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That neither Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> nor any other, can deſcribe the true Nature of a ſinners juſtification, better then God himſelf hath done by his Teaching School-maſter; Namely, by his typical Pattern of juſtifying of the bodies of the National Church from their ceremonial ſins by their typical waſhings, and by the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unlcean, to the ſanctifying of the Body from ceremonial ſins, and to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of the Body, <hi>i.e.</hi> to the juſtifying of the Body from the guilt of their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13.</p>

            <p>And I think I have made it evident, that God hath ordained no other Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in the Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation, to bring believing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Heavenly Inheritance, but the ſupernatural Righteouſneſſe of Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe.</p>

7. And theſe two terms, <hi>a ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>a purification</hi> are alſo uſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>for the blood of Bulls,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. and, ſaith he, this Sin-(Water) is alſo called by the Greeks and Chalde Verſion, <hi>water of sprinkling,</hi> (becauſe it was ſprinkled on the unclean to purifie them)
<hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 18, 19. according to which phraſe, Chriſts blood is called <hi>the blood of ſprinkling, Heb.</hi> 12. 24. becauſe it purifies the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and therefore it was figured by this ſprinkling-Water, in

            <p n="5">5. I will now return again to expound this phraſe, in

<hi>Chatta,</hi> Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore conſider, that the iſſues both of Men and Women (beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorts of ceremonial ſins) cauſed them to be removed away from coming unto Gods holy Temple: until they were firſt cleanſed according to the purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Sanctuary; and after the Womans iſſue was ſtopped, ſhe was ſtill
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 3, 4.
<hi>Amos</hi> 8. 14.</note> in part unclean; and therefore ſhe was commanded to number unto her ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes, and then ſhe was to waſh her ſelf, and then after that ſhe ſhall be clean, <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 13, 28. Namely, ſo far as to fit her for her going ſo far with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the holy Ground, as to bring her ſin-Offering to the Prieſt on her eighth day, <hi>i.e.</hi> Two Turtle-Doves, or two young Pigeons: ſhe ſhall bring them to the Prieſt to the door of the Tent of the Congregation, and the Prieſt ſhall make the one a ſin-Offering, and the other a burnt-Offering, and the Prieſt ſhall make atonement for her before <hi>Jehovah</hi> for the iſſue of her uncleanneſſe, and then ſhe ſhall be (fully) clean: From hence it follows, that until ſhe had obtained Gods atoned Forgiveneſſe by her ſaid ſacrifices, ſhe did continue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved away from having full communion with God in his holy Temple.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But as ſoon as her atonement was procured, her condition was changed or exchanged (as <hi>Kircherus</hi> doth tranſlate the ſaid Greek Word) from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltineſſe to purification, or to juſtification from ſin, or from unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to cleanneſſe; from pollution, to ſanctity; from enmity, to Reconciliation with God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When Chriſt ſaid unto thoſe that ſtood by
<hi>Jeboſua, take away the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Garments from him:</hi> and as ſoon as they were taken away, he ſaid unto him, <hi>I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſſe from thee: And I will cloath thee with change of Rayment,</hi> Zach.
3. 3, 4. This Change was brought to paſſe by that living Fountain of Chriſts Blood which God hath ſet open to all Nations for a Change, or for an Exchange from ſin-guiltineſſe to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſin: Namely, as the blood of Chriſt is the infallible meritorious Cauſe of Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe, to believing Sinners all the World over.</p>

               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:34410:240"/> 8. <hi>Chatta,</hi> Sin, is very often uſed in a metaphorical ſence for ſin-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, juſt in the ſame manner as <hi>Aſham</hi> is for a Treſpaſſe-Offering: as in
<hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 14. <hi>They that ſwear by the Treſpaſſe,</hi> i.e. by the Treſpaſſe-Offering, which the Prieſts of <hi>Samaria</hi> did offer unto God to procure his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned Forgiveneſſe for their Treſpaſſes: and in that Reſpect the <hi>Seventy</hi> do render <hi>Aſham, the proptiation of</hi> Samaria<hi>:</hi> and thence it follows, that they did believe, that upon Gods accepting of it, they ſhould not need any other Righteouſneſſe to bring them to Heaven, but his Reconciled Forgiveneſſe only. And 2. Thence it followes, that in caſe it had been a received Truth among them that no ſinner could get to Heaven, unleſſe God did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the moral Righteouſneſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> con-created Nature unto them, they would doubtleſſe have left ſome foot-ſteps of that Faith, either in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Tranſlation of the

The Prieſt acted as a middle-perſon on the behalf of the people, and for their good, but not in the very perſon of the ſinner, ſo that in Law the ſinner did what the Prieſt did: and hence it follows, that their atonement was not formally procuted by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, until the Prieſt had eaten the peoples ſin-Offering, as Mediators before the Lord in the holy place, but then it was fully and formally made. 3. Hence it follows, that when Chriſt by his Death and Sacrifice did procure Gods atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the iniquities of all believing ſinners, he did bear (or bear away from them) the guilt of all their iniquities.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Chriſt bare all our ſins meritoriouſly by his Death and Sacrifice; For Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins <hi>of the many,</hi> Heb. 9. 28. And thus by <hi>Pauls</hi> Expoſition, Chriſt did bear our ſins, ſo as it was typified by the Prieſts bearing of the ceremonial ſins of the Congregation: Namely, becauſe he did as our Prieſt and Sacrifice thereby procure his Fathers atonement, which doth formally bear away the ſins of all Pelievers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles words in <hi>Verſe</hi> 26. are to be conſidered<hi>: now once in the end of the world:</hi> (Namely, of the Moſaical world) <hi>hath he appeared to put away ſin (i.e.</hi> ſin-Offerings) <hi>by the ſacrifice of himſelf:</hi> Then ſaith he in
<hi>Verſe</hi> 27. <hi>As it is appointed unto men once to dye</hi> (becauſe death was appointed to be the general puniſhment of original ſin) So (in <hi>Ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many:</hi> Hence take notice, that the Apoſtle doth vary the term of Chriſts death, from the condition of our death; for he doth not ſay nor mean, that Chriſt
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:34410:241"/> was appointed to dye by the ſame juſtice that death is inflicted upon all the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſons of <hi>Adam:</hi> but, ſaith he, <hi>he was offered to bear the ſins of the many:</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle doth not mean, that Chriſt bare ſin and puniſhment in a proper ſence as guilty ſinners do by Gods imputation, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> doth make this Text to ſpeak, in <hi>pag.</hi> 45. to maintain his Heterodoxal imputation of ſin to Chriſt, for then his death muſt have been inflicted as the puniſhment of original ſin, as our death is, (as I have alſo noted it in my <hi>Dialogue,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 9.) and then it could not have been accepted of God as a perfect Sacrifice without ſpot and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh<hi>:</hi> But he bare the <hi>ſins of the many</hi> by his meritorious obedience in his Combat of ſufferings, and in his Death and Sacrifice, by the which he procured Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned Forgiveneſſe for <hi>the many:</hi> and by this meanes it was that their ſins were quite born from them; and of this ſee more in my former printed <hi>Reply,</hi> in
<hi>pag.</hi> 147. 195.</p>
            <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 44. <hi>It is very true, that God laid our ſins upon Chriſt as our ſacrifice,</hi> Eſay 53. 12.

In like ſort, God the Son is ſaid to bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our ſins meritoriouſly, by his moſt perfect obedience in his Combat of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and alſo in his Sacrifice, becauſe his obedience is the only procuring cauſe of his Fathers Reconciled Forgiveneſſe, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. When a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſinner therefore hath obtained God the Fathers bearing of his ſins, then he is fully and formally juſtified from ſin and received into Gods ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>David</hi> doth thus explain the Fathers bearing of his ſins, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. 1. ſaying, <hi>bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſions are born:</hi> ſo the Hebrew word

            <p>In my <hi>Dialogue</hi> I ſaid thus, in <hi>pag.</hi> 127.

            <p n="2">2. Saith the <hi>Dialogue:</hi> In this ſence it was that
<hi>Paul</hi> proved, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith was accounted unto him unto Righteouſneſſe, by a teſtimony taken from <hi>David,</hi> in
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. ſaying, even as <hi>Davil</hi> alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſſe of that man unto whom God imputeth Righteouſneſſe without works, ſaying, <hi>bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven and whoſe ſins are covered, bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord doth not impute ſin;</hi> Came this bleſſedneſſe upon the Circumciſion only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, ſaith the Apoſtle, it came upon any other Country-men, aſwell as upon the Circumciſion: if they have but Faith as
<hi>Abraham</hi> had, to Apprehend and receive the Fathers Atonement: by which means only their ſins are forgiven, covered, and not imputed.</p>
            <p>What other Reaſon (ſaith the <hi>Dialogue)</hi> can any man elſe render, why the Apoſtle ſhould enterlace this Teſtimony of
<hi>David,</hi> but to deſcribe how <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith did make him righteous, but becauſe he by his Faith did apprehend and receive the Fathers Atonement, whereby his ſins were forgiven, covered, and not imputed.</p>
            <p>And a little after, the <hi>Dialogue</hi> ſaith, This Doctrine of a ſinners juſtification by Faith, was taught and preached by all the Prophets: For <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth, that all the Prophets do witneſſe, that through the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> whoſoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 10 43. with <hi>Ver.</hi> 45.

<hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay, that leproſie is the Finger of God, and that the only healing is by the hand of the Prieſt that maketh atonement, for by Mercy atonement is made for iniquity <hi>(Prov.</hi> 16. 6.)

And hence it follows, that Gods Atonement procured by Chriſts meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Death and Sacrifice, is the only thing that doth perfectly cleanſe, heal, and make ſound the guilty Souls of believing ſinners.</p>

            <p>And from hence it follows, that Gods gracious Atonement procured by the meritorious obedience of Chriſt in his Combat of ſufferings, and in his Death and Sacrifice, doth not only in ſome good part heal the Souls of believing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (by delivering them from Hell) but it doth alſo fully and perfectly heal their Souls of the guilt of ſin, and it doth bring them alſo into the Favour of God, as heires to the Heavenly Inheritance: For as none that are deadly ſick, can be ſaid to be perfectly healed by delivering them in ſome part from death, unleſſe they be alſo fally reſtored to health: ſo Chriſts death could not reſtore ſinners to perfect health, in caſe he had not merited Gods atonement; and therefore when the penitent

9. 14. And at the Offering of this typical Sacrifice, which procured Gods atonement, there was exceeding great Joy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: For when the burnt-Offering began, the Song of the Lord began alſo

            <p n="3">3. They exerciſed their Joy in Chriſts Sacrifice, and in Gods atonement, that was procured thereby, by three types of ſpiritual Joy:</p>

            <p>From theſe Scriptures it followes: That in caſe Gods non-imputation of ſin were not a certain mark, of a believing ſinners perfect juſtification and Reconciliation: it could not be ſaid to make him bleſſed; For we ſee by experience that a Judges bare forgiveneſs of a Malefactor by his non-imputation of ſin, doth not intitle him to the Judges ſpecial Favour in ſuch manner as Gods non-imputation of ſin doth; in the fulfiliing of his Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation to believing ſinners: Neither doth the Kings general act of indemnity, receive ſinners into ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favor, as Gods non-imputation of ſin doth for the ſake of Chriſts meritorious Sacrifice; And thence it follows, that in the Covenant of Grace, Gods non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſin is as large as his Reconciliation is, and therefore Gods non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the Covenant of Grace, doth ſignifie,

Gods not imputing ſin, is his not remembring it to puniſh it with any proper vindicative puniſhment (though he doth often puniſh them with caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory puniſhments for their greater good.)

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:34410:251"/> not remembring ſin and iniquiry to puniſh it with vindicative puniſhments, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies taht he will mercifully forgive, or be atoned, or be propicious to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe<hi>:</hi> Theſe two poſitions are reciprocal, and therefore they are joyned together, not only in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. but alſo in <hi>Eſay</hi> 41. 25. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions, and will not remember thy ſins;</hi> and hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that when God doth not remember ſin to puniſh it, it is all one as to blot it out.</p>
            <p n="11">11.

<hi>I will cleanſe them from their iniquities, and I will pardon their iniquities, and I will not remember their iniquities,</hi> are ſynonimous terms.</p>
            <p n="12">12. God ſaith thus, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 20. <hi>In thoſe dayes, and at that time, ſaith the Lord:</hi> Namely, when the godly

When God (ſaith he) doth not behold, or ſee iniquity in ſinfull man, it is to hide his face from their ſins, and to blot out all their iniquities, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this 50 Chapter, <hi>Jeremy</hi> doth in his concluſion, in <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. ſhew the Reaſon why their iniquities and ſins cannot be found: and that is (ſaith God) becauſe I will pardon them whom I reſerve (to return home out of their captivity;) From hence take notice, that when God doth forgive ſin, He forgetteth it, and blots it out of his ſight, and out of his remembrance for the ſake of Chriſt the true Propitiatory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. In the time of the firſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity God ſent the godly out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be preſerved in

            <p n="13">13.

<hi>That Gods Forgiveneſſe is called</hi> His Repentance, <hi>or</hi> His not puniſhing ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ODS <hi>Repentance</hi> is of two ſorts: 1. It is his not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good to impenitent ſinners, Or 2. It is his not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of repenting ſinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is his not continuing of good to impenitent ſinners<hi>:</hi> as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6. God repented that he had made man, becauſe he ſaw that the wickedneſſe of man was great in the Earth,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 5. and therefore, in <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. he ſaith, <hi>I will deſtroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth;</hi> in
<hi>Verſe</hi> 6. God is ſaid to have repented: even as when we ſee the Potter to break the ſame Veſſel which he had made good at firſt: we thereupon think that he repented that he had made it, becauſe he ſeeth ſomething in it that had hapned to it, for the which he diſliketh it and breaketh it: Even ſo at the firſt God made man good, even according to his own Image and likeneſs<hi>:</hi> but preſently after, he ſaw that ſin through <hi>Sathans</hi> temptation had hapned to mankind: Now in reſpect of this mutability in man (not in God, for <hi>he repenteth not,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.
29. Jer. 4. 28.) <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, that God Repented that he had made man. 2. In this very ſort, he repented alſo that he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King, becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> did not execute

18. 9, 10. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to build it and to plant it: if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith</hi> I
<hi>ſaid</hi> I <hi>would benefit them.</hi> Our <hi>Annot.</hi> on this Verſe, doth expound it to the ſence above-ſaid.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond kind of Gods Repentance, is his not executing of his threatned puniſhments, on ſuch ſinners as do repent: and in that Reſpect Gods Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is often uſed for a Note of his Reconciled Forgiveneſſe to Repenting and Believing ſinners<hi>:</hi> As for Example, as ſoon as God had certified <hi>Moſes</hi> of the peoples ſin, in making a Calf, and in offering ſacrifices thereto, he told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was purpoſed to conſume them; then <hi>Moſes</hi> made interceſſion for them,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:34410:253"/> ſaying, <hi>Turn from the hotneſſe of thine Anger, and repent of the evil againſt thy people,</hi> Exod. 32. 12. But for this word <hi>Repent,</hi> the <hi>Seventy</hi> render it, <hi>be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,</hi> or <hi>be propitious,</hi> or <hi>be reconciled to the evil of thy people:</hi> which thing, ſaith <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> is here implyed: but ſaith he, the Hebrew phraſe meaneth alſo, the evil of puniſhment, which <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired God to repent of, <hi>i.e.</hi> not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it upon them. And then, in <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. It is ſaid, that
<hi>Jehovah repented of the evil</hi> (of puniſhment <hi>which he had ſpoken to do unto his people,</hi> i.e. forgive

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90. <hi>Moſes</hi> confeſſeth the ſin of the people in the Wilderneſſe, when they thought to have ſtoned <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> for their faithful Report of Gods power to Conquer the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> notwithſtanding the evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ten misbelieving Spies: whereupon God threatned to deſtroy them, but <hi>Moſes</hi> made interceſſion to God for the pardon of their ſin, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Verſe</hi> 20. he obtained it: Namely, thus far, that they ſhould not all be conſumed as one man, at an inſtant: But in <hi>Verſe</hi> 21.

<hi>Canaan;</hi> for that Oath of God made his ſaid Threatning to be a definitive Threatning; Gods Oath to any thing makes it as unalterable as his Eternal Councel is: Gods Oath is a ſure proof that it was ſo decreed by his unalterable Councel<hi>:</hi> of the which he doth never Repent, <hi>Heb.</hi>

33. 11, 12 <hi>As</hi> I <hi>live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked may turn from his way and live.</hi> And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth alſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods Mercy, in

Yea, <hi>Jonah</hi> knew before-hand that God would Repent of the evil, becauſe he was gracious, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>From theſe Scriptures
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t follows, that Gods Repentance is his non-Execution of his threatned puniſhments<hi>:</hi> Namely, it is his Reconciled Forgiveneſs upon mans Repentance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When <hi>Joel</hi> had declared unto <hi>Sion</hi> the terribleneſſe of Gods Judgements for their provoking ſins, he did alſo exhort them to Repentance, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 12, 13. ſaying<hi>: Thus ſaith the Lord, Tura you even to me with all your heart, and with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning, and rent your heart and not your Garments, and turn to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and mercifull, ſlow to Anger, and of great kindneſſe, and repenteth him of the Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it follows, that Gods Repentance upon mans Repentance, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but his merciful Atonement, or his Reconciled Forgiveneſſe; for in this Text his repentance is conjoyned with four Attributes of his reconciled Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 1. He is gracious. 2. Merciful.
3. Slow to Anger; and 4. Great in Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And from theſe Attributes of his reconciled Forgiveneſs he repented him of the evil threatned, ſo that his Repentance on mans Repentance, is nothing elſe but his abundant Reconciled Forgiveneſſe. And 2. From thence alſo it followes, that his Repentance, is his abundant readineſſe and willingneſſe of his non-Execution of his threatned puniſhments upon mans Repentance: Theſe five Attributes of Gods reconciled Forgiveneſſe (with others alſo) ſhould encourage ſinners to ſet earneſtly about the great Duty of ſound Repentance, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 103, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. When the Lord was wrath with <hi>David,</hi> for his proud confidence in the Arm of fleſh, which he declared by his numbring of his people: he was at laſt ſmitten with the conſideration of his ſin, then he repented, and did moſt earneſtly beg of God, that his anger might be rather executed againſt him, then againſt his innocent Subjects, 1
<hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 17. and then when <hi>David</hi> Repented, the Lord is ſaid to Repent; and then he directed <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. where to build an Altar that he might offer burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings thereon: and then <hi>David</hi> did in the Name of the true Sacrifice, call upon the Lord again for his Reconciled Forgiveneſſe, and the Lord was then pleaſed to anſwer his Requeſt, by ſending fire from Heaven to burn his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and commanded his Angel to put up his Sword again into the ſheath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:34410:254"/> And thus <hi>David</hi> by his typical ſacrifices did exerciſe his Faith in Chriſt the true burnt-Offering, and the true peace-Offering, as the only procuring cauſe of Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe, and then alſo he was received again into Gods ſpecial favour, as he made it evident by ſending a fire from Heaven to burn his ſacrifices.</p>
            <p>Concluſion</p>
            <p>From the Premiſes it followes, that Gods atoned Forgiveneſſe for the ſake of Chriſts Sacrifice, is his Reconciled Repentance, 1
<hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 15. by the which he doth not only acquit Repenting and Believing ſinners of the guilt of ſin and puniſhment, but doth alſo receive them into ſpecial Grace and Favour, as perſons fully juſtified from the guilt of ſin, and adopted to the Heavenly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take notice that the laſt nine Chapters, touching the true Nature of Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe, are intended chiefly to ſet out the true Nature of juſtification from ſin, hoping that it will give a fit occaſion for the better clearing of the true Nature of a ſinners juſtification by the induſtry of others.</p>

<hi>Gouge,</hi> on the Heb. ſaith, in <hi>p.</hi> 228.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Therefore there is no condemnation</hi> (but juſtification from the condemning power of ſin) <hi>to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Namely, in him by the union of a true and lively Faith<hi>:</hi> Or thus, There is no condemnation to them that walk not after the Religion of the fleſh, but after the Spirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; But none elſe can walk after the Spirit of that Law but ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus by the union of Faith, and none elſe can be in Chriſt Jeſus by Faith, until they are regenerated by the holy Spirit of Grace, and are begotten again to a lively hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3.</p>

                     <hi>Juſtification by remiſſion of ſins, doth not make a full and abſolute deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance (no more then ſanctification doth) from the law of ſin and death, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral learned men do affirm, that our juſtification ſhall be more perfect at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then it is in this life, and that our bodies are not ſo juſtified now as they ſhall be then?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2: I have often ſhewed that as long as we live in this World, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfectly freed from our ſinning Nature, or from our ſpiritual death in ſin, which Sentence was inflicted on
<hi>Adam</hi> and all his natural Poſterity by the definitive Sentence of God, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. Nor yet can they be freed from the putrifaction of their bodies in the Grave until the Reſurrection. And yet for all this, theſe very ſinners, as ſoon as they do believe that Chriſts obedience, death and Sacrifice in the meritorious cauſe of Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe, they are thereby perfectly freed from the guilt, and from the condemning power, both of their original and actual ſins: and in this ſence it is that <hi>Rolloc</hi> and other ſound Divines do mean, when they affirm, that our juſtification is a full and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute deliverance from the law of ſin and Death: Namely, that it is ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance only as doth free them from the guilt of ſin, as it is the Obligation to eternal death and damnation, which our inherent Sanctity cannot do in this life: and from thence it doth alſo follow, that this deliverance from the body of ſin, which
<hi>Paul</hi> doth thank God for, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 25. doth ſtand only in non-condemnation to ſuch as are in Chriſt by Faith, and that walk not after the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Religion of the fleſh, but after the Spirit of the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> that is to ſay, after Chriſt by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

               <p>THis word <hi>[For]</hi> is here put for another Conjunction cauſal to <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. For it doth expreſſe another Reaſon drawn from the meritorious cauſe, why there is no condemnation, but freedom from the condemning power of the Law of ſin and death to all ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus by Faith, who walk not after the outſide Religion of the fleſh, but after the Spirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, which is done only by Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And this Reaſon is double: 1. Negative, And 2. Affirmative.</p>

In theſe words the Apoſtle doth affirm, that the whole Law though it were kept never ſo exactly by the fleſh, or by the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parts of man, it is in that reſpect weak and not able to juſtifie ſuch kind of Law-workers from their moral ſins, becauſe God never made any ſuch condition that any mans performance of the Law by his fleſh or body ſhould juſtifie his Soul from the condemning power of his moral ſins; no, though he could keep the whole moral Law of Nature as perfectly as <hi>Adam</hi> did in his innocency; for no ſuch condition was made that it ſhould have brought <hi>Adam</hi> to Heaven if he had ſtood in it. But at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> God made a Covenant of Works with his National Church, with this condition, that in caſe they did obſerve the Law of Rites by their bodily performance, it ſhould juſtifie their bodies from their ceremonial ſins; and ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>If the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean ſanctiſieth</hi> (or makes the body holy from ceremonial ſins) <hi>to the purifying of the fleſh,</hi> i.e. to the juſtifying of the body from the guilt of the ſaid ceremonial ſins: but theſe legal works were too weak through this fleſhly performance, to juſtifie the Soul from the guilt of their moral ſins: for it is not poſſible (ſaith the Apoſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4.) that the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould take away (moral) ſins. And again, he ſaith in
<hi>Ver.</hi> 11. That ſuch ſacrifices can never take away (moral) ſins: And again, he ſaith, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. Gifts and Sacrifices could not make him that did the ſervice perfect: <hi>(i.e.</hi> free from the guilt of his moral ſins) as pertaining to the Conſcience. And the Reaſon of the weakneſs of this Law to juſtifie from moral ſins was, becauſe God by his ſpecial Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace and Reconciliation, had reſerved the perfecting of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from the dead works of moral ſins, to the meritorious efficacy of Chriſts Blood, and to the condition of Faith in Chriſts blood to be performed on the ſinners part, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. And then, in <hi>Verſe</hi> 15. his Death is ſaid to <hi>redeem them from thoſe</hi> (moral) <hi>tranſgreſſions that remained unpurged under the bodily works of the firſt Teſtament;</hi> and this is alſo confirmed by the Apoſtle, in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. <hi>By Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>all that believe are juſtified from all things,</hi> (i.e. from all thoſe moral ſins) from which ye could not be juſtified by (the works of)
<hi>Moſes</hi> Law; and of this ſee more in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. at N. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The weakneſſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law to juſtifie the Conſcience from moral ſins by the fleſhly performance thereof, is evident by this, becauſe all thoſe works are called by no better name, then
<hi>fleſhly</hi> or <hi>carnal juſtifications,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. As it is alſo well obſerved by our <hi>Annot.</hi> and by divers other Authors<hi>:</hi> and now I will add Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> unto them: By this Greek word, tranſlated <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> Some (ſaith he) do underſtand Juſtifications or Expiations, and that upon two grounds: 1. Becauſe the performers of the Legal Rites were legally cleanſed
<hi>(i.e.</hi> juſtified) 2. Becauſe they prefigured a true Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This Obſervation of his is worth the marking: 1. Becauſe he expounds the legal juſtifications, to concern the fleſh or body only; by this phraſe, were legally cleanſed. 2. Becauſe this bodily juſtification was ordained to be a type of true Juſtification from moral ſins. And 3. Becauſe he calls true Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the name of <hi>Expiation,</hi> which Expiation is no otherwiſe effected formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:34410:263"/> but by Gods Reconciled Forgiveneſſe, procured by the meritorious Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Chriſts Sacrifice, and apprehended by the Faith of believing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> ſaith alſo, in <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 9. That Chriſt made himſelf the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all Sacrifices which the Law could not do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. His words I have cited, in <hi>Chap.</hi>
15. at <hi>Reply</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Tindals</hi> Bible, doth hint at the weakneſſe of the Law in the foregoing ſence: For, in <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 3. he doth in the Margin cite, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19. (as a parallel to it) which ſpeaks thus: The Law made nothing perfect, but was an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a better Hope, by the which we draw nigh to God; and this Text being conferred with its Context, in
<hi>Ver.</hi> 16. There the Apoſtle doth call the ceremonial Lawes of the Prieſthood, <hi>a carnal Commandement:</hi> And then ſaith he, in
<hi>Ver.</hi> 18. There is a diſanulling of the Commandement for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unprofitableneſſe thereof, becauſe the Law made nothing perfect<hi>:</hi> And then to this 19th. <hi>Ver. Tindal</hi> doth in the Margin cite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>What the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh;</hi> and by the which double citation in both places, he doth ſet out the weakneſſe of the Law, in Reſpect of juſtification from moral ſins.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> in his <hi>Chriſtian Dictionary,</hi> doth give another hint of the ſaid Expoſition of the weakneſſe of the Law through the fleſh to juſtifie; For there at N. 10. he doth thus interpret the word <hi>fleſh,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 1. What hath <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> gotten according to the fleſh? This word
<hi>fleſh,</hi> ſaith he, is expounded in <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. to be the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in obſerving the ceremonial Rites of the Law, (ſuch as were in uſe in his time) which works did not juſtifie his Soul from (moral) ſins in Gods ſight<hi>:</hi> and thus, ſaith he, doth <hi>Beza</hi> and
<hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> interpret this place: And 2. Saith he, the word
<hi>fleſh,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12, 13. and in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3. doth ſignifie the ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Cameron,</hi> doth expound the word
<hi>Fleſh</hi> to this ſence in his <hi>Threefold-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> For in
<hi>Theſis</hi> 74. he ſaith thus: The Sacrifices and Sacraments of the Old Teſtament, are deſervedly called <hi>carnal:</hi> And then in
<hi>Theſis</hi> 75. he ſaith, the Sacrifices, Sacraments, and Ceremonies of the Antients had their carnal uſe, over and beſides their ſpiritual ſignification. So ſaith he, in <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſis</hi> 76. We deny not, but even the Sacraments of the New Teſtament, may have a carnal uſe by the inſtitution and cuſtom of man, but not any ſuch preſcribed to them by any word of God (as the Rites of the <hi>Jewes</hi> had.) And ſaith he, in <hi>Theſis</hi>
77. The ſecond difference is placed in this, that the Sacraments, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Ceremonies of the Old Teſtament, did ſet forth Chriſt, not prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily (becauſe they did belong primarily to the firſt typical Covenant of Works, which were ordained primarily for the bodily juſtification of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church from their ceremonial ſins) But Secundarily, and that but darkly. But the Sacraments of the New Teſtament ſhew forth Chriſt primarily, and
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:34410:263"/> that clearly. And ſaith he, in
<hi>Theſis</hi> 78. Their Sacrifices and Cleanſings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented primarily, a certain carnal Holineſſe (as I have expreſſed it above in the Parentheſis) They figured out Chriſt and the benefits of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The weakneſſe of the Law (through the fleſh) to juſtifie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from moral ſins, is thus deſcribed, in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>There is verily a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling of the Commandement going before for the weakneſſe and unprofitableneſſe thereof:</hi> This Commandment concerning the levitical Prieſthood (ſaith Dr. <hi>Gouge)</hi> is here ſaid to go before, in reference to Chriſts Prieſthood; For, ſaith he, the levitical Prieſthood was a type of Chriſt, Therefore the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement concerning that, muſt needs, (even in time) go before this, for this ſucceeded that, even to accompliſh what that could not: (he doth reaſon juſt ſo as the Apoſtle doth Reaſon in the words before cited, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.). 3. Saith he, The weakneſſe hereof conſiſted even in this, that the Law was utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by it ſelf, and by the ſtrict obſervance of the Rites thereof, to do that which was needful to be done<hi>:</hi> which was to make the Obſervers thereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (namely, to be perfectly juſtified from the condemning guilt of moral ſins.) 4. Saith he, The unprofitableneſſe thereof implieth, that though a man be zealous of the Law, and take much pains, and be at great coſt threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, yet he ſhall not get any thing thereby, but loſe all his pains and coſts<hi>:</hi> And this the Apoſtle found true by experience, for after he had ſet forth his zeal about the Law, (even about the whole Law of
<hi>Moſes)</hi> and had declared how blameleſſe he was touching the Righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, he addeth, <hi>what things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſſe and dung for Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. 6, 7,
8.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Apoſtle ſaith, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>The Law made nothing perfect.</hi> By no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſaith Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> is meant, no man: The Law made no man perfect: and this, (ſaith he) will moſt clearly appear thus<hi>:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Law which makes nothing perfect is weak and unprofitable: But the Law of the levitical Prieſthood makes nothing perfect; Therefore it is weak and unprofitable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this (ſaith he) is evident, becauſe the End of a Law, is to make thoſe to whom it belongeth perfect. Now the Law which cannot effect this (which is the main end thereof) muſt needs be weak and unprofitable: But the meer bodily performance of the Law, was not able to make perfect,
<hi>i.e.</hi> to juſtifie the Conſcience from the guilt of moral ſins<hi>:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, the ſame Law when it is done by Faith in Chriſt (the true end of the Law for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification) then it will make ſuch ſinners to be perfectly juſtified from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning guilt of all their moral ſins. And ſaith Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. Chriſt made himſelf the perfection of all Sacrifices, that ſo he might do that by his Sacrifice which the Law could not do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Holyoke,</hi> in his <hi>Doctrine of Life,</hi> ſaith in <hi>pag.</hi> 8. The ceremonial Law was weak to juſtifie,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. For it was impoſſible that the blood of Bulls and Goats, and Waſhings, ſhould cleanſe the Conſcience from the guils of ſin.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The weakneſſe of the Law to juſtifie the Conſcience through the bodily performance of it, was the great Diſpute of
<hi>Paul</hi> againſt the falſe Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="518" facs="tcp:34410:264"/> 1. He argued thus, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20.
<hi>By the deeds of the Law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified in his ſight;</hi> and therefore he ſaith in <hi>Verſe</hi> 28. We conclude, that a man is juſtified by Faith (only) without the deeds of the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He reaſons thus, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, 3.
<hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by the Law, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God:</hi> For what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham believed God, and it was counted unto him</hi> (as the Condition to be performed on his part) unto juſtification from the guilt of his morall ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paul</hi> doth Reaſon thus, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.
16. <hi>Man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Christ, even as</hi> (We) <hi>have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law: for by the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> But in
<hi>Verſe</hi> 19. he ſaith, <hi>I through the Law</hi> (i.e. through the Law of Faith in Chriſt (who is the only true end of the Law for juſtification to every one that believeth) <hi>am dead to the Law</hi> (i.e. am dead in my affections to the bodily obſervation of the works of the Law) as he alſo ſpeaks, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4, 6. and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 27,
28. and in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 18. he ſaith, <hi>if ye be led by the Spirit ye are not under the Law;</hi> namely, not under the bodily obſervation of the works of the Law for your moral juſtification.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The weakneſſe of the Law through the fleſh to juſtifie, is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is often called fleſh, as in
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 3. Are ye ſo fooliſh? having began in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the fleſh? <hi>(i.e.</hi> by that bodily obſervation of the whole) 2. Saith he, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>We are the</hi> (true)
<hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion which worſhip God in the spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> i.e. which have no confidence of juſtification from moral ſins by the bodily exerciſe of
<hi>Moſes</hi> Law. And 3. He ſaith, in <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>That I might be ſound in him, not having mine own juſtification which is of the Law;</hi> Namely, by the typical works of the Law, which did alſo juſtifie the body of every <hi>Jew</hi> from their ceremonial ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.
13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 23. Doth tell ſuch as are for juſtification by the works of the Law, that they are born only after the fleſh. And in <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. He compares them to
<hi>Iſhmael,</hi> that was born after the fleſh; namely, after the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the fleſh; For when <hi>Sarah</hi> was paſt Child-bearing, ſhe conſulted with her carnal Reaſon, and concluded that now ſhe might have the promiſed Son by giving her Bondmaid <hi>Hagar</hi> unto
<hi>Araham,</hi> and ſo <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was born to her, according to the wiſdom of her fleſhly mind; and juſt ſo the falſe Apoſtles, out of the wiſdom of their fleſhly minds, did perſwade others to obſerve the outward works of the Law, not only for their bodily juſtification, but alſo for the perfect juſtification of their conſcience from the guilt of their moral ſins: And in this Reſpect, ſuch Obſervers of the Law are called
<hi>the children of the fleſh,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. Becauſe they have no new birth at all from the Spirit, but from the fleſh only; and their obſerving of the Law by bodily exerciſe, is called <hi>the wiſdom of the fleſh</hi> only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5: <hi>Paul</hi> doth tell the believing
<hi>Galatians,</hi> That as many as make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, did confirm them to be circumciſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12. But ſaith he, in
<hi>Ver.</hi> 13. Neither they themſelves who are circumciſed, keep the Law, <hi>(i.e.</hi> they do not keep it ſo as it was given to be kept by Faith in Chriſt, For
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:34410:264"/> without Faith in Chriſt it cannot be kept in that ſence as it was given for a Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation: But theſe falſe Apoſtles deſire to have you circumciſed, that they may glory in your fleſh, <hi>i.e.</hi> in your bodily conformity to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt ſaid thus to the carnal <hi>Jewes,</hi> in

And this is his Commandement, <hi>that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another,</hi> 1 John 3. 23. and therefore in theſe Reſpects, theſe Commandements cannot be underſtood of the moral
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:34410:269"/> Law of Nature; For that Law doth not command ſuch a ſupernatural Love, as to believe in Jeſus Chriſt: And in both the ſaid places <hi>Kircherus</hi> doth render the word, which we tranſlate <hi>Commandements,</hi> by <hi>Juſtifications:</hi> as I noted it alſo from the <hi>Seventy,</hi> at N. 2.

<hi>my Ordinances to do them:</hi> Or as others, <hi>that they may keep my judgements.</hi> As <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did, in
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot but wonder at Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> great negligence, that doth cite this place of <hi>Eze.</hi> 20, 11. which is juſt parallel to this Scripture to prove, That the doing of Gods Statutes and Judgements there ſpoken of, is meant, of doing the Covenant of Nature made with <hi>Adam,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 225. ſeeing the Sun at Noon-day is not more clear then this; Namely, That the doing of Gods Statutes and Judgements, in <hi>Eze.</hi> 11. 20. and in <hi>Eze.</hi> 20. 11. is meant, of the ſupernatural doing of them by Faith in Chriſt, according to the Condition that is required to be done in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This word <hi>Dicaioma</hi> is added, for the judgement of God, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. But ſaith Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> there; This word <hi>Dicaioma,</hi> is not here to be underſtood of the moral Law,
<hi>(i.e.</hi> not of the Ten Commandements) which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had not: but of the Heathen Judicials, in puniſhing ſin, which they accounted alſo was for their juſtification from ſin.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This word <hi>Dicaioma,</hi> is uſed alſo for the Religious Rites of the Heathens which they alſo uſed for their juſtification from ſin: But thoſe Rites, becauſe they were but the devices of their own brains, they are called by God, <hi>Statutes of abomination,</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 30. And theſe <hi>Statutes</hi> are alſo called <hi>the Ordinances of the Heathens:</hi> Namely, ſuch as they uſed for their juſtification from ſin, 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. 14, 51. after the <hi>Geneva</hi> tranſlation, but in our latter tranſlation it is, 1
<hi>Mac.</hi> 1. 13 49. &amp; 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 2. 21. And there

               <p n="10">10. We may alſo from hence obſerve a Reaſon, why Gods poſitive Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſometimes put for Rites, in <hi>Numb.</hi>

<hi>pag.</hi> 47, 48. And Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Pſalm</hi>
81. 5. That Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Right or Ordinance made by God, and a duty to be performed to him<hi>:</hi>
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:34410:270"/> And in that Reſpect, <hi>Judgement</hi> is put for <hi>duty,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 3. And it was the duty of the Judges of the <hi>Synedrion,</hi> to judge in all levitical matters that were in difference.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Though I have made diligent ſearch, yet I cannot any where find that the juſtification of the Law, in <hi>Rom,</hi> 8. 4. is put for the Righteouſneſſe of the moral Law of Nature, which Mr.
