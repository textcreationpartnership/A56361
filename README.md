    _ SECT. V.

    _ Object. 1. It is objected by ſome eminent Divines, that a bodily death was only threatned in Gen. 2. 17. becauſe God could not be the Author of inflicting a Spiritual death in ſin: but ſay they, Adam pul'd that upon himſelf, by his wilful ſin (in eating the forbidden fruit) as if God had ſaid thus to Adam; If thou killeſt thy ſelf by thy wilful eating of the forbidden fruit, thou ſhalt be killed: but ſay they, the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. imports ſuch a death as was inflicted by the juſt hand of God, and that can be no other (ſay they) but a bodily death.

    _ Object. 2. Symachus Tranſlation doth make the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. to be no other but a lingering bodily death: for he doth thus tranſlate that Text; In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt become mortal; namely, from that day forwards thou ſhalt become mortal, by a lingering kind of death, until thy ſoul be ſeparated from thy body.

    _ Object. 3. Others do labour to confirm the ſaid expoſition of a lingering bodily death, by the unlimited circumſtance of time, which they th•nk is expreſſed under the word Day: they ſay the word Day is a time certain put for an uncertain; that is to ſay, for a time to come: and ſo they make a lingring bodily death to be threatned in the day or time to come.

    _ Obj•ct. 4. Though you have made it clear to my underſtanding, that a bodily death was not threatned in Gen. 2. 1. 7. for the puniſhment of Adams firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit; yet I think it is held by all, that Adam was liable to a bod•ly death, and to an eternal death in Hell, ipſo facto, for his ſecond new degree of ſinning againſt every branch of the moral Law of nature, which fell upon him before the Covenant of grace and reconciliation was declared in Gen. 3. 15. namely, in the entervale, or in the middle ſpace of time between the execution of his Spiritual death, and the declaration of the Covenant of grace: for as ſoon as Adam was deprived of his concreated life of moral perfections, he could not ſtand ſtill from further ſinning, but inſtantly fell of his own accord into the new degree of Original ſin: and the Scriptures tell us, that God inflicted a bodily death, as ſoon as he was guilty of Original ſin; and therefore he was liable to a bodily death, before the Covenant of grace was declared.

It is objected by ſome eminent Divines, that a bodily death was only threatned in Gen. 2. 17. becauſe God could not be the Author of inflicting a Spiritual death in ſin: but ſay they, Adam pul'd that upon himſelf, by his wilful ſin (in eating the forbidden fruit) as if God had ſaid thus to Adam; If thou killeſt thy ſelf by thy wilful eating of the forbidden fruit, thou ſhalt be killed: but ſay they, the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. imports ſuch a death as was inflicted by the juſt hand of God, and that can be no other (ſay they) but a bodily death.

    _ Object. 2. Symachus Tranſlation doth make the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. to be no other but a lingering bodily death: for he doth thus tranſlate that Text; In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt become mortal; namely, from that day forwards thou ſhalt become mortal, by a lingering kind of death, until thy ſoul be ſeparated from thy body.

    _ Object. 3. Others do labour to confirm the ſaid expoſition of a lingering bodily death, by the unlimited circumſtance of time, which they th•nk is expreſſed under the word Day: they ſay the word Day is a time certain put for an uncertain; that is to ſay, for a time to come: and ſo they make a lingring bodily death to be threatned in the day or time to come.

    _ Obj•ct. 4. Though you have made it clear to my underſtanding, that a bodily death was not threatned in Gen. 2. 1. 7. for the puniſhment of Adams firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit; yet I think it is held by all, that Adam was liable to a bod•ly death, and to an eternal death in Hell, ipſo facto, for his ſecond new degree of ſinning againſt every branch of the moral Law of nature, which fell upon him before the Covenant of grace and reconciliation was declared in Gen. 3. 15. namely, in the entervale, or in the middle ſpace of time between the execution of his Spiritual death, and the declaration of the Covenant of grace: for as ſoon as Adam was deprived of his concreated life of moral perfections, he could not ſtand ſtill from further ſinning, but inſtantly fell of his own accord into the new degree of Original ſin: and the Scriptures tell us, that God inflicted a bodily death, as ſoon as he was guilty of Original ſin; and therefore he was liable to a bodily death, before the Covenant of grace was declared.

    _ Object. 1. It is objected by ſome eminent Divines, that a bodily death was only threatned in Gen. 2. 17. becauſe God could not be the Author of inflicting a Spiritual death in ſin: but ſay they, Adam pul'd that upon himſelf, by his wilful ſin (in eating the forbidden fruit) as if God had ſaid thus to Adam; If thou killeſt thy ſelf by thy wilful eating of the forbidden fruit, thou ſhalt be killed: but ſay they, the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. imports ſuch a death as was inflicted by the juſt hand of God, and that can be no other (ſay they) but a bodily death.

    _ Object. 2. Symachus Tranſlation doth make the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. to be no other but a lingering bodily death: for he doth thus tranſlate that Text; In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt become mortal; namely, from that day forwards thou ſhalt become mortal, by a lingering kind of death, until thy ſoul be ſeparated from thy body.

    _ Object. 3. Others do labour to confirm the ſaid expoſition of a lingering bodily death, by the unlimited circumſtance of time, which they th•nk is expreſſed under the word Day: they ſay the word Day is a time certain put for an uncertain; that is to ſay, for a time to come: and ſo they make a lingring bodily death to be threatned in the day or time to come.

    _ Obj•ct. 4. Though you have made it clear to my underſtanding, that a bodily death was not threatned in Gen. 2. 1. 7. for the puniſhment of Adams firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit; yet I think it is held by all, that Adam was liable to a bod•ly death, and to an eternal death in Hell, ipſo facto, for his ſecond new degree of ſinning againſt every branch of the moral Law of nature, which fell upon him before the Covenant of grace and reconciliation was declared in Gen. 3. 15. namely, in the entervale, or in the middle ſpace of time between the execution of his Spiritual death, and the declaration of the Covenant of grace: for as ſoon as Adam was deprived of his concreated life of moral perfections, he could not ſtand ſtill from further ſinning, but inſtantly fell of his own accord into the new degree of Original ſin: and the Scriptures tell us, that God inflicted a bodily death, as ſoon as he was guilty of Original ſin; and therefore he was liable to a bodily death, before the Covenant of grace was declared.

    _ Object. 1. It is objected by ſome eminent Divines, that a bodily death was only threatned in Gen. 2. 17. becauſe God could not be the Author of inflicting a Spiritual death in ſin: but ſay they, Adam pul'd that upon himſelf, by his wilful ſin (in eating the forbidden fruit) as if God had ſaid thus to Adam; If thou killeſt thy ſelf by thy wilful eating of the forbidden fruit, thou ſhalt be killed: but ſay they, the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. imports ſuch a death as was inflicted by the juſt hand of God, and that can be no other (ſay they) but a bodily death.

    _ Object. 2. Symachus Tranſlation doth make the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. to be no other but a lingering bodily death: for he doth thus tranſlate that Text; In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt become mortal; namely, from that day forwards thou ſhalt become mortal, by a lingering kind of death, until thy ſoul be ſeparated from thy body.

    _ Object. 3. Others do labour to confirm the ſaid expoſition of a lingering bodily death, by the unlimited circumſtance of time, which they th•nk is expreſſed under the word Day: they ſay the word Day is a time certain put for an uncertain; that is to ſay, for a time to come: and ſo they make a lingring bodily death to be threatned in the day or time to come.

    _ Obj•ct. 4. Though you have made it clear to my underſtanding, that a bodily death was not threatned in Gen. 2. 1. 7. for the puniſhment of Adams firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit; yet I think it is held by all, that Adam was liable to a bod•ly death, and to an eternal death in Hell, ipſo facto, for his ſecond new degree of ſinning againſt every branch of the moral Law of nature, which fell upon him before the Covenant of grace and reconciliation was declared in Gen. 3. 15. namely, in the entervale, or in the middle ſpace of time between the execution of his Spiritual death, and the declaration of the Covenant of grace: for as ſoon as Adam was deprived of his concreated life of moral perfections, he could not ſtand ſtill from further ſinning, but inſtantly fell of his own accord into the new degree of Original ſin: and the Scriptures tell us, that God inflicted a bodily death, as ſoon as he was guilty of Original ſin; and therefore he was liable to a bodily death, before the Covenant of grace was declared.

    _ Object. 1. It is objected by ſome eminent Divines, that a bodily death was only threatned in Gen. 2. 17. becauſe God could not be the Author of inflicting a Spiritual death in ſin: but ſay they, Adam pul'd that upon himſelf, by his wilful ſin (in eating the forbidden fruit) as if God had ſaid thus to Adam; If thou killeſt thy ſelf by thy wilful eating of the forbidden fruit, thou ſhalt be killed: but ſay they, the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. imports ſuch a death as was inflicted by the juſt hand of God, and that can be no other (ſay they) but a bodily death.

    _ Object. 2. Symachus Tranſlation doth make the death threatned in Gen. 2. 17. to be no other but a lingering bodily death: for he doth thus tranſlate that Text; In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt become mortal; namely, from that day forwards thou ſhalt become mortal, by a lingering kind of death, until thy ſoul be ſeparated from thy body.

    _ Object. 3. Others do labour to confirm the ſaid expoſition of a lingering bodily death, by the unlimited circumſtance of time, which they th•nk is expreſſed under the word Day: they ſay the word Day is a time certain put for an uncertain; that is to ſay, for a time to come: and ſo they make a lingring bodily death to be threatned in the day or time to come.

    _ Obj•ct. 4. Though you have made it clear to my underſtanding, that a bodily death was not threatned in Gen. 2. 1. 7. for the puniſhment of Adams firſt ſin in eating the forbidden fruit; yet I think it is held by all, that Adam was liable to a bod•ly death, and to an eternal death in Hell, ipſo facto, for his ſecond new degree of ſinning againſt every branch of the moral Law of nature, which fell upon him before the Covenant of grace and reconciliation was declared in Gen. 3. 15. namely, in the entervale, or in the middle ſpace of time between the execution of his Spiritual death, and the declaration of the Covenant of grace: for as ſoon as Adam was deprived of his concreated life of moral perfections, he could not ſtand ſtill from further ſinning, but inſtantly fell of his own accord into the new degree of Original ſin: and the Scriptures tell us, that God inflicted a bodily death, as ſoon as he was guilty of Original ſin; and therefore he was liable to a bodily death, before the Covenant of grace was declared.
